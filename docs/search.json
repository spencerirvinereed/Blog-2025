We learn of their schedule and the scope of their visit, usually in advance.\nThus helping to make sure the house is in order and remove any items that are not necessary for the audit. We got the notice 3 weeks prior to their arrival.\nThey were supporting their daughter-in-law who is an ultra runner by taking care of their new born grandson.\n(Their counterpart, in-laws live an half an hour away).\nWhereas my sister traveled 2000 miles and crossed 2 time zones.\nThere’s saying that refers to summers, that my mom said often.\nWhich is normally explained as,\nBut somehow I heard it a little differently and interpreted it as,\nI thought it was a bit of a stretch to think that a day can make a difference.\nGrowing up in 주안, near Incheon (인천), we saw older ladies dressed in a tight black outfit.\nI had wondered back then, why were these foreigners in our neighborhood?\nLater, I learned that the port of Incheon was a gateway for people coming from the ShanDong (山東) province during the 1920s and earlier.2\nThen my sister explained, there was a restaurant run by a Chinese family in our neighborhood. Even though it was small discovery, it helped me understand why I saw foreigners in 주안,\nBeing born earlier gave her the knowledge and perspective, I didn’t have.\nA blogger mentions that there is a restaurant run by the 5th generation, 화교.3\nIt used to be, by talking with my parents, my worries and concerns were diminished or went away altogether.\nAt times there are questions about life or life as explained by the religion.\nIt was refreshing to talk to my sister who was closer to my parents and witnessed their hard work and often worked side-by-side with them.\nThereby, she has a better understanding of our parents’ views of life and religion.\nWhen I talked about current trends and practices, she brought me back to the beginning or the origin.\nThat place of the beginning as a refugee then an immigrant family and a practioner of a new found religion, after being a seeker of truth.\nFor her, there is no need to venture or investigate current topics and practices, she will rely on the faith of our father and mother.\nPassed the audit with few observations and no findings.\nInstead, learned or realized again the importance of remembering our past, specifically life’s lessons provided by our parents.\nFrom another witness.\nBeing audited by someone that knows me from the beginning has its challenges and benefits.\nShe knows my shortcomings.\nAt times, she can and should be more direct, pointing our things that I should be doing better and fix those things I need to improve or in violation of.\nBut as my parents were, she is kinder and gentler.\nI did sense, without admonishment, that I needed to learn and be more like my parents, in terms of faith and action being congruent.\nIn life and at work, we are audited, reviewed, evaluated.\nPassing the audit, attending meetings, and participating in a congregation is an indication or measure of our involvement and dedication.\nHowever, it is what we do during those times that we are not watched or in private that will ultimately define who we are.\nLike my siblings I need to arrive at the measure and stature of hard working, strong faith yet be a gentle person who overcame the challenges of this life.\nEphesians 4:13"

The remaining diving board base served as a roping practice tool on P-Days.\nOn the plus side, we were a few blocks away from the center of K-Town. Olympic and Western was the unofficial gateway into the Korean enclave.\nIn addition, the famous El Chollo restaurant was on Western Avenue. We also had Chinese Restaurants, the kind we grew up with in Korea. To busy Angelinos, these restaurants became a common meeting place.\nBut the biggest challenge was gaining the trust of members. They welcomed me as their own, but they questioned my language ability.\nSo did I.\nI spoke to my siblings in English. I did speak to my parents in Korean but it was at a grade school level. Outside of home and few Korean members and returned missionaries, had no other contact with Koreans growing up in Maryland.\nSome members even asked whether I was really Korean Since no Korean would lack the language skills as I did. They thought my trainer, who spent 9 months in Korea before transferring to LA, spoke far better Korean.\nI had work to do.\nWorked hard to overcome my fears of speaking in front of people. By meeing people on the streets and at their homes, language comprehension improved. We had some success as well.\nThen my companion of 7 months completed his mission and returned home.\nI was not ready for what was about to happen.\nI was entrusted with 2 missionaries, directly from MTC. One was from Gilbert AZ, the other from Richland WA. I went from one being trained to training new missionaries – 2 of them.\nI was at loss at first. But I no option but to carry on. With their faith, support of family at home and members of the Korean Branch the continued.\nI got to visit each apartment in Koreatown at least twice, some many more times.\nI trained 2 more companions before finishing my mission. 2 Elder 박, one from Chicago and the other from Ogden.\nThus by putting faith in God, I was strengthened. As promised in Ether 12.\nThe language improvement was made gradually without compulsory means."

He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.\nOne day, he demands his share of the inheritance early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake moves to the city, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.\nFor a while, Jake feels on top of the world, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling. Desperate, he looks for work but has no real job experience.\nBroke and ashamed, Jake takes a job at a greasy fast-food restaurant, flipping burgers for minimum wage. He sleeps in a run-down hostel and eats whatever food is left at the restaurant at the end of the night. He remembers how good life was at home—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.\nSwallowing his pride, Jake calls his father, expecting rejection. Instead, his father rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him like nothing ever happened. “Welcome home, son,” he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, “You were lost, but now you’re found.”\nJake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. “I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”\n\nHis father responds, “You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”\n\nJake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA. Someday we will be with him, to be in that simpler world."

This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname\n\nSo the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.\n\nOur family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.\nI have not seen my father’s family record or 계보(系譜).\nI don’t know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.\nI do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.\nMany families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.\nAlso I recall that my grandfather’s mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather’s name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.\nBased on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.\n\nIt is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.\nBoth of my parent’s family added to those figures. All of my father’s siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother’s sisters.\nI still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.\nThat distinctive sound is no longer common.\nBut every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father’s home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father’s hometown of 안변.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.\nIf a way opens up, I would travel to .\n한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47\nWhen I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father’s older brother’s (강금섭) graves.\n\nMy mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)\nShe was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.\nAlthough she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.\n\nOver the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.\nNow that hope is fading.\nMeanwhile, I will follow this teaching\n\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Luke 3:8 (KJV)\n\nAlso, I will do my best to record things that I remember. Things my parents told me about their recollections.\nI hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.\n\nProvo, March 2025\n\n\nUnderstanding Bon-gwan\n\nThe bon-gwan system helps distinguish families with the same surname.\nPeople with the same surname and bon-gwan are considered part of the same extended family and traditionally cannot marry each other.\n\n\n\nNotable Kang Bon-gwan\nSome prominent Kang clans include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBon-gwan (본관)\nRegion (Location)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nJinju (진주 강씨)\nJinju, South Gyeongsang\nOne of the largest Kang clans\n\n\nGoksan (곡산 강씨)\nGoksan, North Hwanghae (now in North Korea)\nHistorically influential in politics\n\n\nNaju (나주 강씨)\nNaju, South Jeolla\nKnown for scholars and officials\n\n\nCheongju (청주 강씨)\nCheongju, North Chungcheong\nSmaller but historically significant\n\n\nAndong (안동 강씨)\nAndong, North Gyeongsang\nKnown for Confucian scholars"

The regularity and frequency diminishes the role and beauty of a winter storm.\n\nPsychologically, snow can evoke nostalgia, reminding people of childhood memories, holidays, or rare moments of peace.

    "text": "At some gatherings, it seems the apex has been reached.\nThe music, the talk, the remembrance of the suffering all come together, all confirmed by the spirit..\nA bit of old self is left behind or let go.\nA new resolutions are made and some kept.\n\nA gentleman rolled up to the front on a mobility knee scooter. carefully, he made his way to the podium and related his experience in the French Polynesia – as a young man, 44 years ago.\nHe recalled teaching a family with a daughter that was 8 years old at the time. He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.\nAs the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together. The older person, read 2 sentences from her phone, in English.\nThen she switched to her native tongue and her daughter translated.\nThey quoted this verse\n\nBehold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?\n\n\nJacob 3:7\n\nAnd how they resolve differences in their home.\nTheir mom made children say these 3 things.\n\nI am sorry\nI apologize\nI love you Then they were to kiss and hug one another.\n\nA simple and effective way to build an eternal family.\nSeeing the impact of a missionary effort and to hear a sweet testimony of a mother and her daughter stirred my soul.\n\n\nTo start the 2nd hour of instruction and edification, the teacher related this.\nAt the beginning of a semester, she assigns the following.\n\nAccount of giving away something of a value, other than money.\n\nThis started a discussion on what things are of value or worth.\nA gentleman said,\n\nUntil it is gone, we don’t know its value.\n\nShe then related of a story, attributed to Socrates,\n\nSocrates and the Small House\nOne day, a wealthy man came to visit Socrates and was surprised to see the great philosopher living in a tiny, modest house. Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."
