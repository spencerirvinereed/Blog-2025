    "text": "Open AI Explanation of Special Relativity\nThe difference in years for an astronaut traveling at near-light speed and then returning to Earth is explained by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, specifically Special Relativity and the concept of time dilation.\n\nKey Concept: Time Dilation\nTime dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers moving relative to each other. According to Einstein’s Special Relativity:\n\nAs an object moves faster, time slows down for it relative to an observer at rest.\nThe effect becomes dramatic as the object approaches the speed of light.\n\n\n\nThe Thought Experiment: The Twin Paradox\nImagine a twin astronaut traveling on a spaceship near the speed of light (say, 99.9% of the speed of light) and then returning to Earth.\n\nDuring the journey:\n\nThe astronaut’s clock (inside the spaceship) runs much slower compared to a clock on Earth.\nTo the astronaut, time feels normal, but for observers on Earth, the astronaut is aging much more slowly.\n\nWhen the astronaut returns to Earth:\n\nBecause time was moving slower for the astronaut, they may have aged only a few years.\nMeanwhile, much more time has passed on Earth—possibly decades or even centuries.\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nSpace and time are not absolute; they are interconnected in spacetime.\nHigh speeds cause space contraction and time dilation, effects predicted and confirmed by relativity.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf an astronaut were to travel at near-light speeds for what feels like a few years for them, they could return to Earth and find that many more years (even centuries) have passed here. This is a real effect and has been experimentally confirmed using high-speed particles and precise atomic clocks."

The time spent in writing can be used to improve lives of others, which in turn improves your life.\nCan you think of instances where followers wrote down teachings of the master?\n손자/孫子\nLet’s see. (using AI Prompts)\nQuite a lot.\nOlder Me\nLikewise, my parents didn’t write much. They were busy making a living and doing good to others.\nSo it is fitting that those of us that benefited most write a little.\n손자/孫子\nThat is a good motivation.\nWhere should I begin, I don’t know much without the AI support.\nOlder Me\nExodus 20:12\nBegin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.\nIf fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life."

Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."

Here’s a summary:\n\nAbraham’s Mission for His Servant\nAbraham, now old, wanted his son Isaac to marry someone from his homeland rather than a Canaanite woman. So, he sent his most trusted servant (traditionally thought to be Eliezer) to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, where his relatives lived. He made the servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s own people and not from the local Canaanites.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Prayer for Guidance\nWhen the servant arrived at a well outside the city, he prayed to God for a sign. He asked that when he asked a young woman for a drink of water, she would not only give him water but also offer to draw water for his camels. This, he believed, would be a sign that she was the right wife for Isaac.\n\n\nRebekah’s Kindness and God’s Sign\nBefore the servant even finished his prayer, Rebekah—the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother, Nahor—came to the well. When the servant asked her for a drink, she eagerly gave him water and also offered to draw water for his camels, just as he had prayed! Since camels can drink a lot, this act showed her kindness, generosity, and hardworking nature.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Confirmation and Gifts\nAmazed, the servant asked who she was. When he learned she was from Abraham’s family, he bowed and thanked God for guiding him. He then gave Rebekah gold jewelry as gifts.\n\n\nRebekah’s Family Approves the Marriage\nThe servant went to Rebekah’s home and explained his mission to her family. Her brother Laban and her father Bethuel agreed that this was God’s will and allowed Rebekah to go with the servant to marry Isaac. Rebekah herself agreed, showing her faith and willingness to follow this destiny.\n\n\nRebekah and Isaac’s Marriage\nRebekah traveled back with the servant to Canaan. When Isaac saw her, he took her into his mother Sarah’s tent and married her. The Bible says he loved her, and she became a comfort to him after his mother’s death.\nThis story highlights faith, divine guidance, and the importance of character in choosing a life partner. Would you like a deeper analysis or a retelling in a different style?"

We learn of their schedule and the scope of their visit, usually in advance.\nThus helping to make sure the house is in order and remove any items that are not necessary for the audit. We got the notice 3 weeks prior to their arrival.\nThey were supporting their daughter-in-law who is an ultra runner by taking care of their new born grandson.\n(Their counterpart, in-laws live an half an hour away).\nWhereas my sister traveled 2000 miles and crossed 2 time zones.\nThere’s saying that refers to summers, that my mom said often.\nWhich is normally explained as,\nBut somehow I heard it a little differently and interpreted it as,\nI thought it was a bit of a stretch to think that a day can make a difference.\nGrowing up in 주안, near Incheon (인천), we saw older ladies dressed in a tight black outfit.\nI had wondered back then, why were these foreigners in our neighborhood?\nLater, I learned that the port of Incheon was a gateway for people coming from the ShanDong (山東) province during the 1920s and earlier.2\nThen my sister explained, there was a restaurant run by a Chinese family in our neighborhood. Even though it was small discovery, it helped me understand why I saw foreigners in 주안,\nBeing born earlier gave her the knowledge and perspective, I didn’t have.\nA blogger mentions that there is a restaurant run by the 5th generation, 화교.3\nIt used to be, by talking with my parents, my worries and concerns were diminished or went away altogether.\nAt times there are questions about life or life as explained by the religion.\nIt was refreshing to talk to my sister who was closer to my parents and witnessed their hard work and often worked side-by-side with them.\nThereby, she has a better understanding of our parents’ views of life and religion.\nWhen I talked about current trends and practices, she brought me back to the beginning or the origin.\nThat place of the beginning as a refugee then an immigrant family and a practioner of a new found religion, after being a seeker of truth.\nFor her, there is no need to venture or investigate current topics and practices, she will rely on the faith of our father and mother.\nPassed the audit with few observations and no findings.\nInstead, learned or realized again the importance of remembering our past, specifically life’s lessons provided by our parents.\nFrom another witness.\nBeing audited by someone that knows me from the beginning has its challenges and benefits.\nShe knows my shortcomings.\nAt times, she can and should be more direct, pointing our things that I should be doing better and fix those things I need to improve or in violation of.\nBut as my parents were, she is kinder and gentler.\nI did sense, without admonishment, that I needed to learn and be more like my parents, in terms of faith and action being congruent.\nIn life and at work, we are audited, reviewed, evaluated.\nPassing the audit, attending meetings, and participating in a congregation is an indication or measure of our involvement and dedication.\nHowever, it is what we do during those times that we are not watched or in private that will ultimately define who we are.\nLike my siblings I need to arrive at the measure and stature of hard working, strong faith yet be a gentle person who overcame the challenges of this life.\nEphesians 4:13"

    "text": "There aren’t many surnames in Korea.\nAccording to Open-AI, GPT, there are approximately 280 family names.\nHowever, top 3 names, Kim, Lee, and Park account for nearly half of the population (~45%).\nGPT further explains,\n\nMany surnames are distinguished by their bon-gwan (본관, 本貫), which indicates the ancestral hometown or clan origin. This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname\n\nSo the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.\n\nOur family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.\nI have not seen my father’s family record or 계보(系譜).\nI don’t know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.\nI do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.\nMany families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.\nAlso I recall that my grandfather’s mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather’s name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.\nBased on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.\n\nIt is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.\nBoth of my parent’s family added to those figures. All of my father’s siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother’s sisters.\nI still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.\nThat distinctive sound is no longer common.\nBut every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father’s home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father’s hometown of 안변.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.\nIf a way opens up, I would travel to .\n한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47\nWhen I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father’s older brother’s (강금섭) graves.\n\nMy mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)\nShe was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.\nAlthough she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.\n\nOver the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.\nNow that hope is fading.\nMeanwhile, I will follow this teaching\n\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Luke 3:8 (KJV)\n\nAlso, I will do my best to record things that I remember. Things my parents told me about their recollections.\nI hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.\n\nProvo, March 2025\n\n\nUnderstanding Bon-gwan\n\nThe bon-gwan system helps distinguish families with the same surname.\nPeople with the same surname and bon-gwan are considered part of the same extended family and traditionally cannot marry each other.\n\n\n\nNotable Kang Bon-gwan\nSome prominent Kang clans include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBon-gwan (본관)\nRegion (Location)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nJinju (진주 강씨)\nJinju, South Gyeongsang\nOne of the largest Kang clans\n\n\nGoksan (곡산 강씨)\nGoksan, North Hwanghae (now in North Korea)\nHistorically influential in politics\n\n\nNaju (나주 강씨)\nNaju, South Jeolla\nKnown for scholars and officials\n\n\nCheongju (청주 강씨)\nCheongju, North Chungcheong\nSmaller but historically significant\n\n\nAndong (안동 강씨)\nAndong, North Gyeongsang\nKnown for Confucian scholars"

Be trained on the work to be done.\nEveryone involved was in agreement. Only difference to be resolved was length of the training period. We were off by factor of nearly 20.\nJapanese team suggested multiple years. Our team thought few weeks was sufficient.\nWe settled at 6 weeks of training.\nWhich side was more accurate, the time will confirm.\n\nIn the intervening years.\nGradual translation has transformed to instant, AI assisted conversion.

With that money, Jake moves to the city, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.\nFor a while, Jake feels on top of the world, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling. Desperate, he looks for work but has no real job experience.\nHe remembers how good life was at home—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.\nSwallowing his pride, Jake calls his father, expecting rejection. Instead, his father rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him like nothing ever happened. “Welcome home, son,” he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, “You were lost, but now you’re found.”\nJake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. “I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”\n\n\nBiblical reference of, The Prodigal Son, where a son recklessly spends his inheritance but is later forgiven by his father.\nThis use of prodigal refers more to someone who strays but later returns rather than just being wasteful.\nHis father responds, “You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”\n\nJake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.\nWe will also be on that train, albeit at different times and travelling at different speed.\nTo the same destination.\nSomeday we will be with him, that model shown by those that preceded us.\nThat spiritual home in this life.\nWhere we are first loved and receive all that our parents have.\nWe in turn, learn how to love, how to give to the next generation.\nGladys Knight & The Pips\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0F9lh8TiSM\nReturn to our spiritual home."

The remaining diving board base served as a roping practice tool on P-Days.\nOn the plus side, we were a few blocks away from the center of K-Town. Olympic and Western was the unofficial gateway into the Korean enclave.\nIn addition, the famous El Chollo restaurant was on Western Avenue. We also had Chinese Restaurants, the kind we grew up with in Korea. To busy Angelinos, these restaurants became a common meeting place.\nBut the biggest challenge was gaining the trust of members. They welcomed me as their own, but they questioned my language ability.\nSo did I.\nI spoke to my siblings in English. I did speak to my parents in Korean but it was at a grade school level. Outside of home and few Korean members and returned missionaries, had no other contact with Koreans growing up in Maryland.\nSome members even asked whether I was really Korean Since no Korean would lack the language skills as I did. They thought my trainer, who spent 9 months in Korea before transferring to LA, spoke far better Korean.\nI had work to do.\nWorked hard to overcome my fears of speaking in front of people. By meeing people on the streets and at their homes, language comprehension improved. We had some success as well.\nThen my companion of 7 months completed his mission and returned home.\nI was not ready for what was about to happen.\nI was entrusted with 2 missionaries, directly from MTC. One was from Gilbert AZ, the other from Richland WA. I went from one being trained to training new missionaries – 2 of them.\nI was at loss at first. But I no option but to carry on. With their faith, support of family at home and members of the Korean Branch the continued.\nI got to visit each apartment in Koreatown at least twice, some many more times.\nI trained 2 more companions before finishing my mission. 2 Elder 박, one from Chicago and the other from Ogden.\nThus by putting faith in God, I was strengthened. As promised in Ether 12.\nThe language improvement was made gradually without compulsory means."

Here’s how it works and why it’s used:\n\nHow a FOG Works\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope operates based on the Sagnac Effect, which is an optical phenomenon where light traveling in opposite directions through a coiled fiber experiences a phase shift when the system rotates. The key components include:\n\n\nCoiled Optical Fiber – Light is transmitted through several kilometers of fiber optic cable wound in a coil.\n\nLaser Source – A laser beam is split into two and sent in opposite directions through the fiber coil.\n\nInterference Detection – When the missile rotates, a phase shift occurs between the two light beams due to the Sagnac Effect, which is measured to determine angular velocity.\n\n\n\n\nWhy FOGs Are Used in Missile Navigation\n\n\nHigh Accuracy – FOGs provide precise rotational data, crucial for guiding missiles toward their targets.\n\nNo Moving Parts – Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, FOGs are solid-state, making them more reliable and durable.\n\nFast Response Time – Optical signals are processed almost instantly, allowing real-time adjustments to missile trajectory.\n\nResistant to External Disturbances – They are less affected by vibrations, accelerations, and electromagnetic interference, which are common in missile environments.\n\nLong Operational Life – Due to their solid-state nature, they have a longer lifespan and lower maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nApplication in Missile Systems\nFOGs are integrated into Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), which track a missile’s position without relying on external signals like GPS. This makes them especially useful in:\n\nBallistic Missiles – Ensuring precise long-range targeting.\nCruise Missiles – Providing accurate navigation for terrain-following and target-seeking.\nAir-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles – Enhancing mid-course and terminal guidance."

That challenges, disappointments, and defeats are a part of this life.\nBut finding meaning and purpose that eminates from a simple song.\nThereby elevating thoughts and actions towards our Deliverer and the Day of Judgement.\nWhether collectively, the 2nd Coming, or individually, as our parents have shown.\n기럭 기럭 기럭이 북~에서 오고\n귀뚤 귀뚤 귀뚜라미 슬피울건만\n서울 가신 오빠는 소식도~ 없고\n나뭇잎만 우수수 떨~어~집니다."

    "text": "M1 vs. M2 Money Supply: Key Differences and Impact on Inflation\nThe M1 and M2 money supplies both measure the amount of money circulating in an economy, but they focus on different types of liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between M1 and M2\n\n\nFeature\nM1\nM2\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nIncludes the most liquid forms of money.\nIncludes M1 plus less liquid savings instruments.\n\n\nComponents\nCurrency in circulation, checking accounts, Other liquid deposits\nEverything in M1, Savings Accounts, Money Market Accounts, Small Time Deposits (CDs under $100k)\n\n\nLiquidity\nHighly liquid (readily available for transactions)\nLess liquid (requires additional steps to access)\n\n\nPurpose\nUsed primarily for immediate spending.\nRepresents money that can be saved but is still accessible.\n\n\nVolatility\nMore volatile; reacts quickly to economic changes.\nMore stable; reflects longer-term savings behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on Inflation\n\nM1 and Inflation:\n\n\nA rapid increase in M1 often signals rising consumer spending, which can push demand higher and contribute to demand-pull inflation.\nConversely, a sharp decrease in M1 may reflect reduced spending power, which can slow economic growth.\n\n\nM2 and Inflation:\n\n\nGrowth in M2 is more closely linked to longer-term inflation trends since it reflects both spending and savings behavior.\nA sharp rise in M2 may indicate excess liquidity, which can eventually spill into consumer prices.\n\n\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nIf the Federal Reserve increases the money supply (M1) rapidly, consumers may spend more, driving up demand for goods and services. Without an increase in supply, this can raise prices, causing inflation.\nOn the other hand, a spike in M2 might show that people are saving more, potentially delaying inflation but signaling future spending capacity.\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\nM1 is a better short-term indicator of spending patterns.\nM2 provides a broader view of money growth and its potential long-term impact on inflation.\n\n\n\n\nM1 Supply and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nFrom Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis\n\nM1 Supply (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (CPIAUCSL) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes M1 Money Supply Predict Inflation or Vice Versa\nThe M1 money supply and inflation are closely linked, but the relationship is complex — one does not always predict the other in a straightforward way. Here’s how the interaction generally works:\n\n1. M1 Growth as a Predictor of Inflation\n\nM1 Expansion → Inflation Risk:\n\nWhen the M1 supply rises rapidly, it often signals increased consumer spending. If demand outpaces the supply of goods and services, demand-pull inflation can occur.\nExample: During economic stimulus periods, expanded M1 may lead to higher prices if consumer spending surges.\n\n✅ M1 growth tends to lead inflation — but only if spending activity rises faster than supply.\n\n\n2. Inflation Influencing M1\n\nInflation → Higher M1 Demand:\n\nIn inflationary periods, consumers may keep more funds in liquid forms (like checking accounts) to cope with rising prices, which can inflate M1 figures.\nExample: In times of high inflation, people may reduce savings in long-term deposits (M2) and instead hold more cash or liquid assets (M1) to maintain spending flexibility.\n\n✅ Inflation can increase M1 as people adjust financial habits.\n\n\n3. Situations Where the Link Breaks\n\nVelocity of Money: If M1 rises but money velocity (the rate money circulates in the economy) falls, inflation may not follow.\nSupply Chain Factors: Inflation can also spike due to supply-side shocks (e.g., oil crises, labor shortages) without direct M1 changes.\n\n\n\nHistorical Example:\n\n2020–2021 (Pandemic Stimulus Era):\nThe U.S. M1 supply surged due to stimulus payments and loose monetary policy.\nInitially, inflation remained low because consumers saved more and spent cautiously.\nBy late 2021, when spending increased, inflation spiked sharply.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nM1 growth is often a leading indicator of inflation, but its predictive power depends on consumer behavior, economic conditions, and supply-side factors.\nInflation can also reshape M1 patterns as people shift toward more liquid assets"

    "text": "I see you have a camera like the one I used to have,\nYou know, cell phone cameras take better photos than those DSLRs.\nA gentleman my age commented, as I walked with a camera Nikon introduced in December 2007, around the “Bowl” at a nearby 公園.\nFurthermore, as a proof, he showed photos of Grand Canyon in February.\nThe ones he took with an iPhone.\nIt was a great set of photos, taken from the South Rim as the shadows from the setting sun highlighted the Canyon.\nI had to agree with him, my old DSLR would not take better photos, if the comparison was based on the visual representation.\nHowever, there is one thing, a limitation of the phone based camera.\nOne cannot take a technically bad photo.\nThat option is no longer available.\nAnd if one can’t take a bad photo how does one learn about\nA manual transmission, often called a stick shift, is a type of gearbox used in vehicles that requires the driver to manually change gears using a clutch pedal and a gear stick (or shift lever).\nManual transmissions have seen a significant decline in the U.S. automotive market over the past few decades. In 1995, approximately 26.8% of vehicles sold at CarMax featured manual transmissions. In 2018 that figure dropped to 3.7%\nThere has been a resurgence driven by younger drivers seeking a more engaging driving experience and a sense of nostalgia along with enthusiasts that continue to seek them out for the control and driving pleasure they offer.1\nLearned to drive a stick shift on streets of El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula,\nBecause Koreans were scattered throughout the mission and some outside the county, we were given an car, with an automatic transmission - A Chevrolet Chevette2.\nInitially, my senior companion, with 6 months remaining, drove exclusively around K-Town as well as many locations that required freeway driving.\nThere was another set of Korean-speaking elders that covered the south half of the mission, that is mainly LA county and some of the Orange county.\nThey also had a Chevette but their tan version had a manual transmission.\nElder C from Hawaii suggested I learn how to drive it.\nNo pre-training, we just drove around the streets of Bellflower and Norwalk and hoped I would learn.\nIn the beginning, stalled out the engine due to improper timing between the clutch pedal and the stick shift.\nBut after making a few drivers upset along the Rosecrans Avenue, I got the hang of it.\nDidn’t have a car during college years.\nGoing back to college, as a graduate student, my parents bought a car for me.\nOpted for a Subaru Station Wagon, a DL model with a 4WD, well suited for Utah.\nThe car served me well with its ample cargo space, when 2nd row seats were folded down.\nHowever when Sister K married me, she didn’t know how to drive a manual transmission.\nGave an effort to teach her but I was not as efficient nor patient as Elder C.\nWe didn’t get very far, Sister K enlisted help of a her friend and she could drive the Subaru while I was at school.\nWhen we bought, with help from our parents, a Mercury Villager, Sister K was elated.\nShe could take children to school and was free from the clutch and stick routine.\nMuch like the Artificial Intelligence aided, enabled understanding and task completion, the essential part of growth and learning has been eliminated.\nThese days, it is difficult to kill an engine while driving.\nEven if one was able to override the algorithm and take a bad shot, it would be difficult to pin-point what contributed to photos being out of focus.\nThat agency or choice is not available in press-button photo taking and AI generated answers.\nIn taking or making photos, like in other efforts in life, mistakes will be made.\nIn those mistakes, lessons are given and learned.\nThe gentleman that sold me the Nikon camera said,\n9 months into owning the camera, there are buttons, settings and mirrors that I haven’t used.\nSeveral times, I was tempted to use the automatic mode.\nSadly Nikon doesn’t provide that mode, closest mode is the Aperture Mode.\nI had to learn, or re-learn, the inter-relationship of the aperture opening, shutter speed and the light sensitivity as measured in ISO.3\nPhotos taken with this camera has a number of flaws.\nBut it represents the reality better.\nThat is, it matches what my eyes sees better than the cell phone logic generated photos.\nLearned for myself, rather than pursuing skills and equipment to make photos like those of the professionals, make a photo or record of your own experience.\nIf the goal or the pursuit is to understand how light is captured and processed, then purchase a used DSLR and go take pictures of unique offerings in the neighborhood"
