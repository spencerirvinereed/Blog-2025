    "text": "At some gatherings, it seems the apex has been reached.\nThe music, the talk, the remembrance of the suffering all come together, all confirmed by the spirit..\nA bit of old self is left behind or let go.\nA new resolutions are made and some kept.\n\nA gentleman rolled up to the front on a mobility knee scooter. carefully, he made his way to the podium and related his experience in the French Polynesia – as a young man, 44 years ago.\nHe recalled teaching a family with a daughter that was 8 years old at the time. He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.\nAs the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together. The older person, read 2 sentences from her phone, in English.\nThen she switched to her native tongue and her daughter translated.\nThey quoted this verse\n\nBehold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?\n\n\nJacob 3:7\n\nAnd how they resolve differences in their home.\nTheir mom made children say these 3 things.\n\nI am sorry\nI apologize\nI love you Then they were to kiss and hug one another.\n\nA simple and effective way to build an eternal family.\nSeeing the impact of a missionary effort and to hear a sweet testimony of a mother and her daughter stirred my soul.\n\n\nTo start the 2nd hour of instruction and edification, the teacher related this.\nAt the beginning of a semester, she assigns the following.\n\nAccount of giving away something of a value, other than money.\n\nThis started a discussion on what things are of value or worth.\nA gentleman said,\n\nUntil it is gone, we don’t know its value.\n\nShe then related of a story, attributed to Socrates,\n\nSocrates and the Small House\nOne day, a wealthy man came to visit Socrates and was surprised to see the great philosopher living in a tiny, modest house. Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."

    "text": "When families visit, especially older siblings, it is an internal audit.\nWe learn of their schedule and the scope of their visit, usually in advance.\nMaking sure the house is in order and remove any items that are not necessary for the audit.\nWe got the notice 3 weeks prior to their arrival.\nThey were supporting their daughter-in-law who is an ultra runner by taking care of their new born grandson.\n(Their counterpart, in-laws live an half an hour away).\nWhereas my sister traveled 2000 miles and crossed 2 time zones.\nThere’s saying that refers to summers, that my mom said often.\n오뉴월(五六*月) 볕하루만 쬐도 낫다.1\nWhich is normally explained as,\nBut somehow I heard it a little differently and interpreted it as,\nI thought it was a bit of a stretch to think that a day can make a difference.\nGrowing up in 주안, near Incheon (인천), we saw older ladies dressed in a tight black outfit.\nI had wondered back then, why were these foreigners in our neighborhood?\nLater, I learned that the port of Incheon was a gateway for people coming from the ShanDong (山東) province during the 1920s and earlier.2\nThen my sister explained, there was a restaurant run by a Chinese family in our neighborhood.\nEven though it was small discovery, it helped me understand why I saw foreigners in 주안,\nA blogger mentions that there is a restaurant run by the 5th generation, 화교.3\nIt used to be, by talking with my parents, my worries and concerns were diminished or went away altogether.\nAt times there are questions about life or life as explained by the religion.\nIt was refreshing to talk to my sister who was closer to my parents and witnessed their hard work and often worked side-by-side with them.\nThereby, she has a better understanding of their views of life and religion.\nWhen I talked about current trends and practices, she brought me back to the beginning or the origin.\nThat place of the beginning as a immigrant family and a practioner of a new found religion.\nFor her, there is no need to venture or investigate topics and practices, she will rely on the faith of our father and mother.\nPassed the audit with few observations and no findings.\nInstead, learned or realized again the importance of remembering our past, specifically life’s lessons provided by our parents.\nFrom another witness.\nBeing audited by someone that knows me from the beginning has its challenges and benefits.\nShe knows my shortcomings.\nAt times, she can and should be more direct, pointing our things that I should be doing better and fix those things I need to improve or in violation of.\nBut as my parents were, she is kinder and gentler.\nI did sense, without admonishment, that I needed to learn and be more like my parents, in terms of faith and action being congruent.\nIn life and at work, we are audited, reviewed, evaluated.\nPassing the audit, attending meetings, and participating in a congregation is an indication or measure of our involvement and dedication.\nHowever, it is what we do during those times that we are not watched or in private that will ultimately define who we are.\nLike my siblings I need to arrive at the measure and stature of hard working, strong faith yet be a gentle people who overcame the challenges of this life.\n“Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”\nEphesians 4:13"
