For business related shopping.\nWe have a set route or routine. Shop at a few wholesale places followed by a lunch.\nTypically we choose a Korean restaurant, staffed by a Hispanic workers. Sometimes restaurant choices are made, not so much for food but for sentimentl reasons.\nWe waved to the cooks that would prepare the meal, behind the glass wall. As we often do, we ran into an acquaintance. Met her son, daughter-in-law and her mother.\nThe regular, nostalgic dishes were ordered.\nAfterwards, drove across town to be at the new gathering place for Asians and those familiar with Asian cuisine.\nNo shortage of options, plus new building were being built.\nStopped by a stall that was selling 雞爪\nI hadn’t seen a wholesale offering of them in decades.\nStarted a conversation with the owner.\nI asked a few questions in my very limited 普通话.\nAsked about the dishes and where he was from\nSurprisingly he understood me.\n(Thinking it over, I think he anticipated my questions rather than actually hearing my pronunciations).\nI was happy that he carried on the conversation and told him of the areas I have visited.\nAnd the variety of offering of that boundless continent or a union of multi-national, cultural states or provinces.\nIt brought back memories of feeling the energy of its citizens and eager businessmen ready to make deals.\n\nFor dinner, visited a place in South Provo, run by a Vietnamese family.\nThe place was recommended by a Vietnamese co-worker.\nAs we were getting ready for a feast, met a member from the YSA days\nIt was good to catch up.\n\nGrateful that we have a full array of options.\nBut as we settled down to eat, after the church, was reminded how a simple dish from childhood is the best.\nSister K made a simple, 맑은 감자국 (clear soup made with potatoes) Golden potatoes, cut like a fat french fries, just a touch of spices.\nYes there are many options in life, As Led Zeppelin said a while back,\n\nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run There’s still time to change the road you’re on\n\nToday, we saved the driving for later and stay home and enjoyed a simple meal."

    "text": "M1 vs. M2 Money Supply: Key Differences and Impact on Inflation\nThe M1 and M2 money supplies both measure the amount of money circulating in an economy, but they focus on different types of liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between M1 and M2\n\n\nFeature\nM1\nM2\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nIncludes the most liquid forms of money.\nIncludes M1 plus less liquid savings instruments.\n\n\nComponents\nCurrency in circulation, checking accounts, Other liquid deposits\nEverything in M1, Savings Accounts, Money Market Accounts, Small Time Deposits (CDs under $100k)\n\n\nLiquidity\nHighly liquid (readily available for transactions)\nLess liquid (requires additional steps to access)\n\n\nPurpose\nUsed primarily for immediate spending.\nRepresents money that can be saved but is still accessible.\n\n\nVolatility\nMore volatile; reacts quickly to economic changes.\nMore stable; reflects longer-term savings behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on Inflation\n\nM1 and Inflation:\n\n\nA rapid increase in M1 often signals rising consumer spending, which can push demand higher and contribute to demand-pull inflation.\nConversely, a sharp decrease in M1 may reflect reduced spending power, which can slow economic growth.\n\n\nM2 and Inflation:\n\n\nGrowth in M2 is more closely linked to longer-term inflation trends since it reflects both spending and savings behavior.\nA sharp rise in M2 may indicate excess liquidity, which can eventually spill into consumer prices.\n\n\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nIf the Federal Reserve increases the money supply (M1) rapidly, consumers may spend more, driving up demand for goods and services. Without an increase in supply, this can raise prices, causing inflation.\nOn the other hand, a spike in M2 might show that people are saving more, potentially delaying inflation but signaling future spending capacity.\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\nM1 is a better short-term indicator of spending patterns.\nM2 provides a broader view of money growth and its potential long-term impact on inflation.\n\n\n\n\nM1 Supply and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nFrom Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis\n\nM1 Supply (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (CPIAUCSL) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes M1 Money Supply Predict Inflation or Vice Versa\nThe M1 money supply and inflation are closely linked, but the relationship is complex — one does not always predict the other in a straightforward way. Here’s how the interaction generally works:\n\n1. M1 Growth as a Predictor of Inflation\n\nM1 Expansion → Inflation Risk:\n\nWhen the M1 supply rises rapidly, it often signals increased consumer spending. If demand outpaces the supply of goods and services, demand-pull inflation can occur.\nExample: During economic stimulus periods, expanded M1 may lead to higher prices if consumer spending surges.\n\n✅ M1 growth tends to lead inflation — but only if spending activity rises faster than supply.\n\n\n2. Inflation Influencing M1\n\nInflation → Higher M1 Demand:\n\nIn inflationary periods, consumers may keep more funds in liquid forms (like checking accounts) to cope with rising prices, which can inflate M1 figures.\nExample: In times of high inflation, people may reduce savings in long-term deposits (M2) and instead hold more cash or liquid assets (M1) to maintain spending flexibility.\n\n✅ Inflation can increase M1 as people adjust financial habits.\n\n\n3. Situations Where the Link Breaks\n\nVelocity of Money: If M1 rises but money velocity (the rate money circulates in the economy) falls, inflation may not follow.\nSupply Chain Factors: Inflation can also spike due to supply-side shocks (e.g., oil crises, labor shortages) without direct M1 changes.\n\n\n\nHistorical Example:\n\n2020–2021 (Pandemic Stimulus Era):\nThe U.S. M1 supply surged due to stimulus payments and loose monetary policy.\nInitially, inflation remained low because consumers saved more and spent cautiously.\nBy late 2021, when spending increased, inflation spiked sharply.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nM1 growth is often a leading indicator of inflation, but its predictive power depends on consumer behavior, economic conditions, and supply-side factors.\nInflation can also reshape M1 patterns as people shift toward more liquid assets"

    "text": "Open AI Explanation of Special Relativity\nThe difference in years for an astronaut traveling at near-light speed and then returning to Earth is explained by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, specifically Special Relativity and the concept of time dilation.\n\nKey Concept: Time Dilation\nTime dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers moving relative to each other. According to Einstein’s Special Relativity:\n\nAs an object moves faster, time slows down for it relative to an observer at rest.\nThe effect becomes dramatic as the object approaches the speed of light.\n\n\n\nThe Thought Experiment: The Twin Paradox\nImagine a twin astronaut traveling on a spaceship near the speed of light (say, 99.9% of the speed of light) and then returning to Earth.\n\nDuring the journey:\n\nThe astronaut’s clock (inside the spaceship) runs much slower compared to a clock on Earth.\nTo the astronaut, time feels normal, but for observers on Earth, the astronaut is aging much more slowly.\n\nWhen the astronaut returns to Earth:\n\nBecause time was moving slower for the astronaut, they may have aged only a few years.\nMeanwhile, much more time has passed on Earth—possibly decades or even centuries.\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nSpace and time are not absolute; they are interconnected in spacetime.\nHigh speeds cause space contraction and time dilation, effects predicted and confirmed by relativity.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf an astronaut were to travel at near-light speeds for what feels like a few years for them, they could return to Earth and find that many more years (even centuries) have passed here. This is a real effect and has been experimentally confirmed using high-speed particles and precise atomic clocks."

He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.\nAs the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together. The older person, read 2 sentences from her phone, in English.\nThen she switched to her native tongue and her daughter translated.\nThey quoted this verse\n\nBehold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?\n\n\nJacob 3:7\n\nAnd how they resolve differences in their home.\nTheir mom made children say these 3 things.\n\nI am sorry\nI apologize\nI love you Then they were to kiss and hug one another.\n\nA simple and effective way to build an eternal family.\nSeeing the impact of a missionary effort and to hear a sweet testimony of a mother and her daughter stirred my soul.\n\n\nTo start the 2nd hour of instruction and edification, the teacher related this.\nAt the beginning of a semester, she assigns the following.\n\nAccount of giving away something of a value, other than money.\n\nThis started a discussion on what things are of value or worth.\nA gentleman said,\n\nUntil it is gone, we don’t know its value.\n\nShe then related of a story, attributed to Socrates,\n\nSocrates and the Small House\nOne day, a wealthy man came to visit Socrates and was surprised to see the great philosopher living in a tiny, modest house. Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."

Here’s a summary:\n\nAbraham’s Mission for His Servant\nAbraham, now old, wanted his son Isaac to marry someone from his homeland rather than a Canaanite woman. So, he sent his most trusted servant (traditionally thought to be Eliezer) to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, where his relatives lived. He made the servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s own people and not from the local Canaanites.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Prayer for Guidance\nWhen the servant arrived at a well outside the city, he prayed to God for a sign. He asked that when he asked a young woman for a drink of water, she would not only give him water but also offer to draw water for his camels. This, he believed, would be a sign that she was the right wife for Isaac.\n\n\nRebekah’s Kindness and God’s Sign\nBefore the servant even finished his prayer, Rebekah—the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother, Nahor—came to the well. When the servant asked her for a drink, she eagerly gave him water and also offered to draw water for his camels, just as he had prayed! Since camels can drink a lot, this act showed her kindness, generosity, and hardworking nature.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Confirmation and Gifts\nAmazed, the servant asked who she was. When he learned she was from Abraham’s family, he bowed and thanked God for guiding him. He then gave Rebekah gold jewelry as gifts.\n\n\nRebekah’s Family Approves the Marriage\nThe servant went to Rebekah’s home and explained his mission to her family. Her brother Laban and her father Bethuel agreed that this was God’s will and allowed Rebekah to go with the servant to marry Isaac. Rebekah herself agreed, showing her faith and willingness to follow this destiny.\n\n\nRebekah and Isaac’s Marriage\nRebekah traveled back with the servant to Canaan. When Isaac saw her, he took her into his mother Sarah’s tent and married her. The Bible says he loved her, and she became a comfort to him after his mother’s death.\nThis story highlights faith, divine guidance, and the importance of character in choosing a life partner. Would you like a deeper analysis or a retelling in a different style?"

My mom suggested he take a break from study and volunteer for a military service.\n(military service in those days were not mandatory)\nUnderstanding the family situation, my uncle volunteered.\nEither due to his exam taking skills or propensity for studying, he earned a family visit credit.\nAt the time he was stationed at 김해공명학교, performing civil engineering duties within the military.\nThe distance from 인천 to 김해 is about 500 km.\nI imagine trains in those days traveled about 50km per hour.

We learn of their schedule and the scope of their visit, usually in advance.\nThus helping to make sure the house is in order and remove any items that are not necessary for the audit. We got the notice 3 weeks prior to their arrival.\nThey were supporting their daughter-in-law who is an ultra runner by taking care of their new born grandson.\n(Their counterpart, in-laws live an half an hour away).\nWhereas my sister traveled 2000 miles and crossed 2 time zones.\nThere’s saying that refers to summers, that my mom said often.\nWhich is normally explained as,\nBut somehow I heard it a little differently and interpreted it as,\nI thought it was a bit of a stretch to think that a day can make a difference.\nGrowing up in 주안, near Incheon (인천), we saw older ladies dressed in a tight black outfit.\nI had wondered back then, why were these foreigners in our neighborhood?\nLater, I learned that the port of Incheon was a gateway for people coming from the ShanDong (山東) province during the 1920s and earlier.2\nThen my sister explained, there was a restaurant run by a Chinese family in our neighborhood. Even though it was small discovery, it helped me understand why I saw foreigners in 주안,\nBeing born earlier gave her the knowledge and perspective, I didn’t have.\nA blogger mentions that there is a restaurant run by the 5th generation, 화교.3\nIt used to be, by talking with my parents, my worries and concerns were diminished or went away altogether.\nAt times there are questions about life or life as explained by the religion.\nIt was refreshing to talk to my sister who was closer to my parents and witnessed their hard work and often worked side-by-side with them.\nThereby, she has a better understanding of our parents’ views of life and religion.\nWhen I talked about current trends and practices, she brought me back to the beginning or the origin.\nThat place of the beginning as a refugee then an immigrant family and a practioner of a new found religion, after being a seeker of truth.\nFor her, there is no need to venture or investigate current topics and practices, she will rely on the faith of our father and mother.\nPassed the audit with few observations and no findings.\nInstead, learned or realized again the importance of remembering our past, specifically life’s lessons provided by our parents.\nFrom another witness.\nBeing audited by someone that knows me from the beginning has its challenges and benefits.\nShe knows my shortcomings.\nAt times, she can and should be more direct, pointing our things that I should be doing better and fix those things I need to improve or in violation of.\nBut as my parents were, she is kinder and gentler.\nI did sense, without admonishment, that I needed to learn and be more like my parents, in terms of faith and action being congruent.\nIn life and at work, we are audited, reviewed, evaluated.\nPassing the audit, attending meetings, and participating in a congregation is an indication or measure of our involvement and dedication.\nHowever, it is what we do during those times that we are not watched or in private that will ultimately define who we are.\nLike my siblings I need to arrive at the measure and stature of hard working, strong faith yet be a gentle person who overcame the challenges of this life.\nEphesians 4:13"

The remaining diving board base served as a roping practice tool on P-Days.\nOn the plus side, we were a few blocks away from the center of K-Town. Olympic and Western was the unofficial gateway into the Korean enclave.\nIn addition, the famous El Chollo restaurant was on Western Avenue. We also had Chinese Restaurants, the kind we grew up with in Korea. To busy Angelinos, these restaurants became a common meeting place.\nBut the biggest challenge was gaining the trust of members. They welcomed me as their own, but they questioned my language ability.\nSo did I.\nI spoke to my siblings in English. I did speak to my parents in Korean but it was at a grade school level. Outside of home and few Korean members and returned missionaries, had no other contact with Koreans growing up in Maryland.\nSome members even asked whether I was really Korean Since no Korean would lack the language skills as I did. They thought my trainer, who spent 9 months in Korea before transferring to LA, spoke far better Korean.\nI had work to do.\nWorked hard to overcome my fears of speaking in front of people. By meeing people on the streets and at their homes, language comprehension improved. We had some success as well.\nThen my companion of 7 months completed his mission and returned home.\nI was not ready for what was about to happen.\nI was entrusted with 2 missionaries, directly from MTC. One was from Gilbert AZ, the other from Richland WA. I went from one being trained to training new missionaries – 2 of them.\nI was at loss at first. But I no option but to carry on. With their faith, support of family at home and members of the Korean Branch the continued.\nI got to visit each apartment in Koreatown at least twice, some many more times.\nI trained 2 more companions before finishing my mission. 2 Elder 박, one from Chicago and the other from Ogden.\nThus by putting faith in God, I was strengthened. As promised in Ether 12.\nThe language improvement was made gradually without compulsory means."

He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.\nOne day, he demands his share of the inheritance early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake moves to the city, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.\nFor a while, Jake feels on top of the world, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling. Desperate, he looks for work but has no real job experience.\nHe remembers how good life was at home—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.\nSwallowing his pride, Jake calls his father, expecting rejection. Instead, his father rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him like nothing ever happened. “Welcome home, son,” he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, “You were lost, but now you’re found.”\nJake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. “I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”\n\n\nBiblical reference of, The Prodigal Son, where a son recklessly spends his inheritance but is later forgiven by his father.\nThis use of prodigal refers more to someone who strays but later returns rather than just being wasteful.\nHis father responds, “You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”\n\nJake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.\nWe will also be on that train, albeit at different times and travelling at different speed.\nTo the same destination.\nSomeday we will be with him, that model shown by those that preceded us.\nThat spiritual home in this life.\nWhere we are first loved and receive all that our parents have.\nWe in turn, learn how to love, how to give to the next generation.\nGladys Knight & The Pips\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0F9lh8TiSM\nReturn to our spiritual home."

Only one who could explain the meaning didn’t speak our language.\nWe were stuck.\nOnly solution was to send our associates, who would work with their associates. Be trained on the work to be done.\nEveryone involved was in agreement. Only difference to be resolved was length of the training period. We were off by factor of nearly 20.\nJapanese team suggested multiple years. Our team thought few weeks was sufficient.\nWe settled at 6 weeks of training.\nWhich side was more accurate, the time will confirm.\n\nIn the intervening years.\nGradual translation has transformed to instant, AI assisted conversion. Also there is no shortage of interpretation of results.\nWhere are ones suggested length of time necessary to make it our own. Always relying others to make meaning for us."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There aren’t many surnames in Korea.\nAccording to Open-AI, GPT, there are approximately 280 family names.\nHowever, top 3 names, Kim, Lee, and Park account for nearly half of the population (~45%).\nGPT further explains,\n\nMany surnames are distinguished by their bon-gwan (본관, 本貫), which indicates the ancestral hometown or clan origin. This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname\n\nSo the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.\n\nOur family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.\nI have not seen my father’s family record or 계보(系譜).\nI don’t know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.\nI do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.\nMany families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.\nAlso I recall that my grandfather’s mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather’s name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.\nBased on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.\n\nIt is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.\nBoth of my parent’s family added to those figures. All of my father’s siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother’s sisters.\nI still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.\nThat distinctive sound is no longer common.\nBut every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father’s home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father’s hometown of 안변.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.\nIf a way opens up, I would travel to .\n한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47\nWhen I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father’s older brother’s (강금섭) graves.\n\nMy mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)\nShe was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.\nAlthough she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.\n\nOver the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.\nNow that hope is fading.\nMeanwhile, I will follow this teaching\n\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Luke 3:8 (KJV)\n\nAlso, I will do my best to record things that I remember. Things my parents told me about their recollections.\nI hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.\n\nProvo, March 2025\n\n\nUnderstanding Bon-gwan\n\nThe bon-gwan system helps distinguish families with the same surname.\nPeople with the same surname and bon-gwan are considered part of the same extended family and traditionally cannot marry each other.\n\n\n\nNotable Kang Bon-gwan\nSome prominent Kang clans include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBon-gwan (본관)\nRegion (Location)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nJinju (진주 강씨)\nJinju, South Gyeongsang\nOne of the largest Kang clans\n\n\nGoksan (곡산 강씨)\nGoksan, North Hwanghae (now in North Korea)\nHistorically influential in politics\n\n\nNaju (나주 강씨)\nNaju, South Jeolla\nKnown for scholars and officials\n\n\nCheongju (청주 강씨)\nCheongju, North Chungcheong\nSmaller but historically significant\n\n\nAndong (안동 강씨)\nAndong, North Gyeongsang\nKnown for Confucian scholars"

As James Q. Wilson wrote:\n\n“We learn to cope with the people of this world because we learn to cope with the members of our family. Those who flee the family flee the world; bereft of the [family’s] affection, tutelage, and challenges, they are unprepared for the [world’s] tests, judgments, and demands” (The Moral Sense [1993], 163).\n\nHow ironical that some go “into a far country” (Luke 15:13), leaving the nourishing family garden—in which there may be some weeds—and go into a desert with its tumbling sagebrush.\n\nLike serving a mission, in my family no one talked about it to me, I certainly wasn’t pressured.\nHaving an idyllic time at a large university, where it was talked about but never forced.\nThough when I turned 25, people in passing used the menace, as in\n&gt; A menace to a society\nBit strong, a person or thing that is likely to cause harm; a threat or danger.\n—\nGrateful for professors and students at BYU for teaching me how to conduct myself.\nHow free society functions, no compulsion, right principles.\nThose members in the BYU 1st Stake that taught me how to live a life in the gospel.\n\nMy training consisted of my family.\nWatching other families in the church.\nTeaching people of LA in their homes and getting a glimpse of a married life.\nSpent a summer reading about the Eternal Marriage.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/35311_eng.pdf\n(found out later that Sister K read the same manual)\n\nAlong with the conversion to the gospel.\nConversion to the marriage is an on-going effort.\nNo certificate is required, given at a time when two people of understanding years, make a commitment to be together and raise a family together.\nCan’t think of more wonderful show of faith.\nPersonal commitment, made in front of others.\nCase of private commitment that is shared publicly\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) is a crucial component in missile navigation systems, providing highly accurate angular velocity measurements to ensure precise guidance and control. Here’s how it works and why it’s used:\n\nHow a FOG Works\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope operates based on the Sagnac Effect, which is an optical phenomenon where light traveling in opposite directions through a coiled fiber experiences a phase shift when the system rotates. The key components include:\n\n\nCoiled Optical Fiber – Light is transmitted through several kilometers of fiber optic cable wound in a coil.\n\nLaser Source – A laser beam is split into two and sent in opposite directions through the fiber coil.\n\nInterference Detection – When the missile rotates, a phase shift occurs between the two light beams due to the Sagnac Effect, which is measured to determine angular velocity.\n\n\n\n\nWhy FOGs Are Used in Missile Navigation\n\n\nHigh Accuracy – FOGs provide precise rotational data, crucial for guiding missiles toward their targets.\n\nNo Moving Parts – Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, FOGs are solid-state, making them more reliable and durable.\n\nFast Response Time – Optical signals are processed almost instantly, allowing real-time adjustments to missile trajectory.\n\nResistant to External Disturbances – They are less affected by vibrations, accelerations, and electromagnetic interference, which are common in missile environments.\n\nLong Operational Life – Due to their solid-state nature, they have a longer lifespan and lower maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nApplication in Missile Systems\nFOGs are integrated into Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), which track a missile’s position without relying on external signals like GPS. This makes them especially useful in:\n\nBallistic Missiles – Ensuring precise long-range targeting.\nCruise Missiles – Providing accurate navigation for terrain-following and target-seeking.\nAir-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles – Enhancing mid-course and terminal guidance."

The time spent in writing can be used to improve lives of others, which in turn improves your life.\nCan you think of instances where followers wrote down teachings of the master?\n손자/孫子\nLet’s see. (using AI Prompts)\nQuite a lot.\nOlder Me\nLikewise, my parents didn’t write much. They were busy making a living and doing good to others.\nSo it is fitting that those of us that benefited most write a little.\n손자/孫子\nThat is a good motivation.\nWhere should I begin, I don’t know much without the AI support.\nOlder Me\nExodus 20:12\nBegin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.\nIf fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life."

That were confiscated by the communists, shortly after her father’s passing.\nNot being allowed to visit or correspond with loved ones for over 70 years.\nBut we carry that desire to return to our 본관(本貫), family origins.\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\nMy parents bore and overcame crushing disappoints in their lifetime.\nYet they found purpose and meaning in their lives through their inborn grit and faith and hope in Christ Jesus.\nThey waited for their Elder Brother to come and right the wrong.\nHowever, they left this life without realizing their hopes of liberation of a people and experiencing a reconciliation with their loved ones again.\nI hope to emulate some of that grit. That challenges, disappointments, and defeats are a part of this life.\nBut finding meaning and purpose that eminates from a simple song.\nThereby elevating thoughts and actions towards our Deliverer and the Day of Judgement.\nWhether collectively, the 2nd Coming, or individually, as our parents have shown.\n기럭 기럭 기럭이 북~에서 오고\n귀뚤 귀뚤 귀뚜라미 슬피울건만\n서울 가신 오빠는 소식도~ 없고\n나뭇잎만 우수수 떨~어~집니다."

    "text": "The Prince of Egypt (1998)\nDidn’t think any new adaptation could add to the Ten Commandments narrative and impact a new generation.\nHowever, when Dreamworks Animation released their interpretation, An Animated Musical / Biblical Epic, the result was enlightening.\nCecil B. DeMille expanded and perfected the somewhat new medium of a large format, color movies, with large sets, costumes, and character development.\nThe Prince of Egypt infused the storytelling via animation with a large scale scenes and character development. But this version added something else, a modern adaptation of the songs and prayers of the Hebrew slaves.\n\n…With the sting of the whip on my shoulder\nWith the salt of my sweat on my brow\nElohim, God on high, can you hear your people cry?\n\n\n\nHelp us now\nThis dark hour\nDeliver us\n\n\n\nHear our call, deliver us\nLord of all, remember us\nHere in this burning sand\nDeliver us\n\n\n\nThere’s a land You promised us\nDeliver us to the Promised Land\n\n\nThe Opening Song, Deliver Us\n\nThen Jethro (Brian Stokes Mitchell) delivered this song,\n\nSo how can you see what your life is worth\nOr where your value lies?\nYou can never see through the eyes of man\nYou must look at your life\nLook at your life through heaven’s eyes\n\n\n\n\nRock Canyon, 16 June 2025\n\n\n\n\nIf the Ten Commandments were retold today, what would it be like?\nWould it rival or exceed CGIs of the Marvel Universe or the Star Wars series?\nWhat is the relevance of a 3000 year old story?\n\nPerhaps the King’s Chronicles offers a clue,\n\n11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:  12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.  13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?\n\n\nIn life and its manifestations or interpretations, some seek for the dramatic, a great and strong wind, earthquakes or the fire.\nBut life’s essence is in the small, still things.\nAs when Moses mother pled,\n\nHush now my baby, be still, love, don’t cry Sleep as you’re rocked by the stream Sleep and remember my last lullaby So I’ll be with you when you dream\n\nIt is repeated each time a new baby is welcomed into the world. And the mother is delivered and makes a plead to God – as did Moses’ mother.\nPrevious plagues and deliverance from it, those miracles was to transform the people of Israel. And Moses was transformed as he delivered the commandments to the people. Through those public manifestations but more so through many private moments with God, Moses was changed.\nAs was my mother and my father.\nMy father carried the painful reminder of an industrial accident that he suffered in his early 20s. My mother’s father passed away when she was 14 years of age. She had to take on the role of the head of the household.\nBecause of those challenges in this life, they were able to show us how to survive and thrive.\nThe greatest understanding about life, I learned from them is this, They were steadfast.\nThey were consistent, both in public as well as in public. In times of prosperity and time of famine. And they demonstrated this phrase by Dag Hammarskjöld\n\n“It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses,”\n\nThat I may do the same, seek God and find myself and fulfill wishes of my parents.\nThis my longing on this day.\n22 June 2025 Son of 황현실 & 강은섭\n\n\n\nOrem Temple, 16 June 2025"

This can shift Passover later, causing Easter to occur before Passover in rare years.\nThe Council of Nicaea (325 AD) fixed the method for calculating Easter, decoupling it from the Jewish calendar, which is why the dates are similar but not identical."

    "text": "There is a spot along the Lake Bonneville Trail, where one can see the 5 northern Utah County temples.\nSaratoga Springs, Timpanogos, Lindon, Orem, and Provo (Rock Canyon)\nA bit further to the north, one can see the 2 remaining temples to the south.\nProvo City Center and Payson\n\nBefore the Richmond Temple, he would have to spend a full day to attend the Washington DC temple some 2~3 hours away.\nNow with the temple about 30 minutes away, he serves on weekends and attends a session during the week.\nI reflected on the temple availability and my temple attendance.\nI have access to 5 temples within 30 minutes.\nHave much less enthusiasm.\nI was grateful for his testimony of the temple.\n\nMet a friend for a lunch.\nA childhood and a primary friend.\nThis was the 3rd time we met since days in the 인천 답동 Ward.\nThe reason for his visit was,\n\nHis grandchild asked why his grandparents never show up for grandparents day.\n\nSo they flew in from Richmond, VA to be at the event.\nHe attended the local Korean Ward that meets in the Orem Sunset Stake Building.\nAlthough he is a year younger, we joined the 답동와드 about the same time.\nLearned that his father was from 황해도 area, my mother also lived there, before her escape to South\nDuring lunch he provided an abbreviated history of the church in the area we grew up in\nIn addition, he updated the early Korean Saints of 인천, as he sketched the family trees of each family.\n\n\n\n\n답동와드 primary friends: Author (Front Center) and the Friend (Rear Right)\n\n\nMy friend immigrated some 30 years after our family moved to the United States.\nBecause of that he had a fresh, more objective views than me.\nHe said, in general people in America tend to perform services more readily and it is part of their being.\nI was taken back and felt that this something I strive to do, but come up short.\n\nAs we parted, I learned more from this visit.\nPerhaps, on next visit, I will have some progress to report to him."

    "text": "I see you have a camera like the one I used to have,\nNowdays cell phone cameras take better photos than those DSLRs.1\nA gentleman my age commented, as I walked with a camera Nikon introduced in December 2007, around the “Bowl” at a nearby 公園.\nFurthermore, as a proof, he showed photos of Grand Canyon in February.\nThe ones he took with an iPhone.\nIt was a great set of photos, taken from the South Rim as the shadows from the setting sun highlighted the Canyon.\nI had to agree with him, this old DSLR would not take better photos, if the comparison was based on the visual representation.\nHowever, there is one thing, a limitation of the phone based camera.\nOne cannot take a technically bad photo.\nThat option is no longer available.\nAnd if one can’t take a bad photo how does one learn about\nA manual transmission, often called a stick shift, is a type of gearbox used in vehicles that requires the driver to manually change gears using a clutch pedal and a gear stick (or shift lever).\nManual transmissions have seen a significant decline in the U.S. automotive market over the past few decades. In 1995, approximately 26.8% of vehicles sold at CarMax featured manual transmissions. In 2018 that figure dropped to 3.7%\nThere has been a resurgence driven by younger drivers seeking a more engaging driving experience and a sense of nostalgia along with enthusiasts that continue to seek them out for the control and driving pleasure they offer.2\nLearned to drive a stick shift on streets of El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula,\nBecause Koreans were scattered throughout the mission and some outside the county, we were given an car, with an automatic transmission - A Chevrolet Chevette3.\nInitially, my senior companion, with 6 months remaining, drove exclusively around K-Town as well as many locations that required freeway driving.\nThere was another set of Korean-speaking elders that covered the south half of the mission, that is mainly LA county and some of the Orange county.\nThey also had a Chevette but their tan version had a manual transmission.\nElder C from Hawaii suggested I learn how to drive it.\nNo pre-training, we just drove around the streets of Bellflower and Norwalk and hoped I would learn.\nIn the beginning, stalled out the engine due to improper timing between the clutch pedal and the stick shift.\nBut after making a few drivers upset along the Rosecrans Avenue, I got the hang of it.\nDidn’t have a car during college years.\nGoing back to college, as a graduate student, my parents bought a car for me.\nOpted for a Subaru Station Wagon, a DL model with a 4WD, well suited for Utah.\nThe car served me well with its ample cargo space, when 2nd row seats were folded down.\nHowever when Sister K married me, she didn’t know how to drive a manual transmission.\nGave an effort to teach her but I was not as efficient nor patient as Elder C.\nWe didn’t get very far, Sister K enlisted help of a her friend and she could drive the Subaru while I was at school.\nWhen we bought, with help from our parents, a Mercury Villager, Sister K was elated.\nShe could take children to school and was free from the clutch and stick routine.\nMuch like the Artificial Intelligence aided, enabled understanding and task completion, the essential part of growth and learning has been eliminated.\nThese days, it is difficult to kill an engine while driving.\nEven if one was able to override the algorithm and take a bad shot, it would be difficult to pin-point what contributed to photos being out of focus.\nThat agency or choice is not available in press-button photo taking and AI generated answers.\nIn taking or making photos, like in other efforts in life, mistakes will be made.\nIn those mistakes, lessons are given and learned.\nThe gentleman that sold me the Nikon camera said,\n9 months into owning the camera, there are buttons, settings and mirrors that I haven’t used.\nSeveral times, I was tempted to use the automatic mode.\nSadly Nikon doesn’t provide that mode, closest mode is the Aperture Mode.\nI had to learn, or re-learn, the inter-relationship of the aperture opening, shutter speed and the light sensitivity as measured in ISO.4\nPhotos taken with this camera has a number of flaws.\nBut it represents the reality better.\nThat is, it matches what my eyes sees better than the cell phone logic generated photos.\nLearned for myself, rather than pursuing skills and equipment to make photos like those of the professionals, make a photo or record of your own experience.\nIf the goal or the pursuit is to understand how light is captured and processed, then purchase a used DSLR and go take pictures of unique offerings in the neighborhood"
