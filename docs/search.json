For business related shopping.\nWe have a set route or routine. Shop at a few wholesale places followed by a lunch.\nTypically we choose a Korean restaurant, staffed by a Hispanic workers. Sometimes restaurant choices are made, not so much for food but for sentimentl reasons.\nWe waved to the cooks that would prepare the meal, behind the glass wall. As we often do, we ran into an acquaintance. Met her son, daughter-in-law and her mother.\nThe regular, nostalgic dishes were ordered.\nAfterwards, drove across town to be at the new gathering place for Asians and those familiar with Asian cuisine.\nNo shortage of options, plus new building were being built.\nStopped by a stall that was selling 雞爪\nI hadn’t seen a wholesale offering of them in decades.\nStarted a conversation with the owner.\nI asked a few questions in my very limited 普通话.\nAsked about the dishes and where he was from\nSurprisingly he understood me.\n(Thinking it over, I think he anticipated my questions rather than actually hearing my pronunciations).\nI was happy that he carried on the conversation and told him of the areas I have visited.\nAnd the variety of offering of that boundless continent or a union of multi-national, cultural states or provinces.\nIt brought back memories of feeling the energy of its citizens and eager businessmen ready to make deals.\n\nFor dinner, visited a place in South Provo, run by a Vietnamese family.\nThe place was recommended by a Vietnamese co-worker.\nAs we were getting ready for a feast, met a member from the YSA days\nIt was good to catch up.\n\nGrateful that we have a full array of options.\nBut as we settled down to eat, after the church, was reminded how a simple dish from childhood is the best.\nSister K made a simple, 맑은 감자국 (clear soup made with potatoes) Golden potatoes, cut like a fat french fries, just a touch of spices.\nYes there are many options in life, As Led Zeppelin said a while back,\n\nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run There’s still time to change the road you’re on\n\nToday, we saved the driving for later and stay home and enjoyed a simple meal."

And the mother is delivered and makes a plead to God – as did Moses’ mother.\nPrevious plagues and deliverance from it, those miracles was to transform the people of Israel. And Moses was transformed as he delivered the commandments to the people. Through those public manifestations but more so through many private moments with God, Moses was changed.\nAs was my mother and my father.\nThey embodied principles captured in the song, When You Believe,\n\n…My hearts so full, I can’t explain Seeking faith and speakin’ words I never thought I’d say\n\nMy father carried the painful reminder of an industrial accident that he suffered in his early 20s. My mother’s father passed away when she was 14 years of age. She had to take on the role of the head of the household.\nKoreans have had similar experiences and history as other nations. However, we don’t have the rich heritage of stories as the people of Israel. In case of my family, we lack both written and oral history.\nBut through my parents’ lives, particularly their challenges in this life, they were able to show us how to survive and thrive.\nThe greatest understanding about life, I learned from them is this, They were steadfast.\nThey were consistent, both in public as well as in private. In times of prosperity and time of famine.\nThey demonstrated this phrase by Dag Hammarskjöld\n\n“It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual  than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses,”\n\nThat I may do the same, seek God and find myself and fulfill wishes of my parents.\nThis my longing on this day.\n22 June 2025 Son of 황현실 & 강은섭\n\n\n\nOrem Temple, 16 June 2025"

This can shift Passover later, causing Easter to occur before Passover in rare years.\nThe Council of Nicaea (325 AD) fixed the method for calculating Easter, decoupling it from the Jewish calendar, which is why the dates are similar but not identical."

The time spent in writing can be used to improve lives of others, which in turn improves your life.\nCan you think of instances where followers wrote down teachings of the master?\n손자/孫子\nLet’s see. (using AI Prompts)\nQuite a lot.\nOlder Me\nLikewise, my parents didn’t write much. They were busy making a living and doing good to others.\nSo it is fitting that those of us that benefited most write a little.\n손자/孫子\nThat is a good motivation.\nWhere should I begin, I don’t know much without the AI support.\nOlder Me\nExodus 20:12\nBegin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.\nIf fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life."

His ideas survive through the works of Plato (e.g., The Republic, Apology) and Xenophon.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE)\n\nWritings by: His disciples\n\nThe Analects is a collection of Confucius’ sayings and ideas compiled by his followers after his death.\n\nBuddha (Siddhartha Gautama) (c. 563–483 BCE)\n\nWritings by: Buddhist monks and disciples\n\nBuddha’s teachings were passed down orally for centuries before being written down in texts like the Tripitaka.\n\nJesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BCE–30 CE)\n\nWritings by: His apostles and early followers\n\nThe New Testament was written by apostles such as Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\n\nMuhammad (570–632 CE)\n\nWritings by: His companions (Sahaba)\n\nThe Quran was compiled after Muhammad’s death based on his recitations memorized and recorded by his followers.\n\nPythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE)\n\nWritings by: Pythagorean school members\n\nPythagoras himself left no writings; his ideas are known through later thinkers like Philolaus and others.\n\nLaozi (Lao Tzu) (c. 6th century BCE)\n\nWritings by: His followers\n\nWhile the Tao Te Ching is attributed to Laozi, some scholars believe it was compiled by disciples.\n\nFrancis of Assisi (1181–1226 CE)\n\nWritings by: His followers\n\nMany of his teachings were transmitted through works like The Little Flowers of St. Francis.\n\nRamakrishna (1836–1886 CE)\n\nWritings by: Swami Vivekananda and other disciples\n\nHis philosophy and spiritual insights were preserved in texts like The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.\n\n\nThese instances highlight how influential figures often relied on oral traditions, with followers later documenting their ideas."

A quest for freedom, a place to call home, and a chance to improve the living standard.\nThough I have not visited South America I had the opportunity of meeting and working with people from Perú, Colombia, and Brazil all within the same company.\nIn addition I have met people from Bulgaria and Iran and number of people that have served their missions in countries that speak Spanish, Chinese Mandarin and Swedish among others\nRecently coworker moved into the same building and we visited over our common interest – audio equipment.\nHe is a fan of Nakamichi any particular Nelson Pass2designed equipment.\nWe also shared a mutual affinity to analog records.\nThen he mention that he came over from Australia in 1992\nAlso,he told he was from Vietnam, in particular from south Vietnam.

    "text": "At some gatherings, it seems the apex has been reached.\nThe music, the talk, the remembrance of the suffering all come together, all confirmed by the spirit..\nA bit of old self is left behind or let go.\nA new resolutions are made and some kept.\n\nA gentleman rolled up to the front on a mobility knee scooter. carefully, he made his way to the podium and related his experience in the French Polynesia – as a young man, 44 years ago.\nHe recalled teaching a family with a daughter that was 8 years old at the time. He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.\nAs the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together. The older person, read 2 sentences from her phone, in English.\nThen she switched to her native tongue and her daughter translated.\nThey quoted this verse\n\nBehold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?\n\n\nJacob 3:7\n\nAnd how they resolve differences in their home.\nTheir mom made children say these 3 things.\n\nI am sorry\nI apologize\nI love you Then they were to kiss and hug one another.\n\nA simple and effective way to build an eternal family.\nSeeing the impact of a missionary effort and to hear a sweet testimony of a mother and her daughter stirred my soul.\n\n\nTo start the 2nd hour of instruction and edification, the teacher related this.\nAt the beginning of a semester, she assigns the following.\n\nAccount of giving away something of a value, other than money.\n\nThis started a discussion on what things are of value or worth.\nA gentleman said,\n\nUntil it is gone, we don’t know its value.\n\nShe then related of a story, attributed to Socrates,\n\nSocrates and the Small House\nOne day, a wealthy man came to visit Socrates and was surprised to see the great philosopher living in a tiny, modest house. Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."

And it would confirm that I inherited many of my views on life, both here and hereafter, from them.\nFor their lives and the persona were transmitting through stories about them and how their children lived their teachings.\nI would surmise that one was a devoted husband, loving father, spiritual, entrepreneurial. The other cared for the things of this life more than the spiritual.\nThe friends and work took precedence over the family matters. His talent in singing and good looks meant he was in demand. And that gathering often involved alcohol and ended with some type of game of wager.\nThe one was able to build a small yet thriving enterprise in his early 30s. The other lived a life similar to a song by the Temptations, called Papa was a Rolling Stone.\nEstablishing and maintaining a home, a foundation of both physical and spiritual, is the role of parents.\nMy parents came from homes with a different level of a foundation.

    "text": "Vägmärken (Markings, or more literally Waymarks)\nPublished in 1963, it is the only book by former UN secretary general, Dag Hammarskjöld3.\nThe book introduction in Amazon.com states.\nThis book tells almost nothing of his daily work, or of his thoughts about world events. Instead, it focuses on his struggle and changing relationship with God.\nMarkings is distinctive, as W.H. Auden remarks in his foreword, as a record of “the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the via activa and the via contemplativa.” It reflects its author’s efforts to live his creed, his belief that all men are equally the children of God and that faith and love require of him a life of selfless service to others. For Hammarskjöld, “the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.” Markings is not only a fascinating glimpse of the mind of a great man, but also a moving spiritual classic that has left its mark on generations of readers.\n\n\nTo be nothing in the self-effacement of humility, yet, for the sake of the task, to embody its whole weight and importance in your earing, as the one who has been called to undertake it. To give to people, works, poetry, art, what the self can contribute, and to take, simply and freely, what belongs to it by reason of its identity. Praise and blame, the winds of success and adversity, blow over such a life without leaving a trace or upsetting its balance.\n\n\nDH"

The remaining diving board base served as a roping practice tool on P-Days.\nOn the plus side, we were a few blocks away from the center of K-Town. Olympic and Western was the unofficial gateway into the Korean enclave.\nIn addition, the famous El Chollo restaurant was on Western Avenue. We also had Chinese Restaurants, the kind we grew up with in Korea. To busy Angelinos, these restaurants became a common meeting place.\nBut the biggest challenge was gaining the trust of members. They welcomed me as their own, but they questioned my language ability.\nSo did I.\nI spoke to my siblings in English. I did speak to my parents in Korean but it was at a grade school level. Outside of home and few Korean members and returned missionaries, had no other contact with Koreans growing up in Maryland.\nSome members even asked whether I was really Korean Since no Korean would lack the language skills as I did. They thought my trainer, who spent 9 months in Korea before transferring to LA, spoke far better Korean.\nI had work to do.\nWorked hard to overcome my fears of speaking in front of people. By meeing people on the streets and at their homes, language comprehension improved. We had some success as well.\nThen my companion of 7 months completed his mission and returned home.\nI was not ready for what was about to happen.\nI was entrusted with 2 missionaries, directly from MTC. One was from Gilbert AZ, the other from Richland WA. I went from one being trained to training new missionaries – 2 of them.\nI was at loss at first. But I no option but to carry on. With their faith, support of family at home and members of the Korean Branch the continued.\nI got to visit each apartment in Koreatown at least twice, some many more times.\nI trained 2 more companions before finishing my mission. 2 Elder 박, one from Chicago and the other from Ogden.\nThus by putting faith in God, I was strengthened. As promised in Ether 12.\nThe language improvement was made gradually without compulsory means."

He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.\nOne day, he demands his share of the inheritance early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake moves to the city, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.\nFor a while, Jake feels on top of the world, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling. Desperate, he looks for work but has no real job experience.\nHe remembers how good life was at home—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.\nSwallowing his pride, Jake calls his father, expecting rejection. Instead, his father rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him like nothing ever happened. “Welcome home, son,” he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, “You were lost, but now you’re found.”\nJake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. “I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”\n\n\nBiblical reference of, The Prodigal Son, where a son recklessly spends his inheritance but is later forgiven by his father.\nThis use of prodigal refers more to someone who strays but later returns rather than just being wasteful.\nHis father responds, “You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”\n\nJake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.\nWe will also be on that train, albeit at different times and travelling at different speed.\nTo the same destination.\nSomeday we will be with him, that model shown by those that preceded us.\nThat spiritual home in this life.\nWhere we are first loved and receive all that our parents have.\nWe in turn, learn how to love, how to give to the next generation.\nGladys Knight & The Pips\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0F9lh8TiSM\nReturn to our spiritual home."

    "text": "There aren’t many surnames in Korea.\nAccording to Open-AI, GPT, there are approximately 280 family names.\nHowever, top 3 names, Kim, Lee, and Park account for nearly half of the population (~45%).\nGPT further explains,\n\nMany surnames are distinguished by their bon-gwan (본관, 本貫), which indicates the ancestral hometown or clan origin. This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname\n\nSo the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.\n\nOur family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.\nI have not seen my father’s family record or 계보(系譜).\nI don’t know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.\nI do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.\nMany families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.\nAlso I recall that my grandfather’s mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather’s name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.\nBased on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.\n\nIt is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.\nBoth of my parent’s family added to those figures. All of my father’s siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother’s sisters.\nI still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.\nThat distinctive sound is no longer common.\nBut every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father’s home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father’s hometown of 안변.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.\nIf a way opens up, I would travel to .\n한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47\nWhen I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father’s older brother’s (강금섭) graves.\n\nMy mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)\nShe was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.\nAlthough she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.\n\nOver the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.\nNow that hope is fading.\nMeanwhile, I will follow this teaching\n\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Luke 3:8 (KJV)\n\nAlso, I will do my best to record things that I remember. Things my parents told me about their recollections.\nI hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.\n\nProvo, March 2025\n\n\nUnderstanding Bon-gwan\n\nThe bon-gwan system helps distinguish families with the same surname.\nPeople with the same surname and bon-gwan are considered part of the same extended family and traditionally cannot marry each other.\n\n\n\nNotable Kang Bon-gwan\nSome prominent Kang clans include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBon-gwan (본관)\nRegion (Location)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nJinju (진주 강씨)\nJinju, South Gyeongsang\nOne of the largest Kang clans\n\n\nGoksan (곡산 강씨)\nGoksan, North Hwanghae (now in North Korea)\nHistorically influential in politics\n\n\nNaju (나주 강씨)\nNaju, South Jeolla\nKnown for scholars and officials\n\n\nCheongju (청주 강씨)\nCheongju, North Chungcheong\nSmaller but historically significant\n\n\nAndong (안동 강씨)\nAndong, North Gyeongsang\nKnown for Confucian scholars"

Here’s a summary:\n\nAbraham’s Mission for His Servant\nAbraham, now old, wanted his son Isaac to marry someone from his homeland rather than a Canaanite woman. So, he sent his most trusted servant (traditionally thought to be Eliezer) to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, where his relatives lived. He made the servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s own people and not from the local Canaanites.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Prayer for Guidance\nWhen the servant arrived at a well outside the city, he prayed to God for a sign. He asked that when he asked a young woman for a drink of water, she would not only give him water but also offer to draw water for his camels. This, he believed, would be a sign that she was the right wife for Isaac.\n\n\nRebekah’s Kindness and God’s Sign\nBefore the servant even finished his prayer, Rebekah—the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother, Nahor—came to the well. When the servant asked her for a drink, she eagerly gave him water and also offered to draw water for his camels, just as he had prayed! Since camels can drink a lot, this act showed her kindness, generosity, and hardworking nature.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Confirmation and Gifts\nAmazed, the servant asked who she was. When he learned she was from Abraham’s family, he bowed and thanked God for guiding him. He then gave Rebekah gold jewelry as gifts.\n\n\nRebekah’s Family Approves the Marriage\nThe servant went to Rebekah’s home and explained his mission to her family. Her brother Laban and her father Bethuel agreed that this was God’s will and allowed Rebekah to go with the servant to marry Isaac. Rebekah herself agreed, showing her faith and willingness to follow this destiny.\n\n\nRebekah and Isaac’s Marriage\nRebekah traveled back with the servant to Canaan. When Isaac saw her, he took her into his mother Sarah’s tent and married her. The Bible says he loved her, and she became a comfort to him after his mother’s death.\nThis story highlights faith, divine guidance, and the importance of character in choosing a life partner. Would you like a deeper analysis or a retelling in a different style?"

Here’s how it works and why it’s used:\n\nHow a FOG Works\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope operates based on the Sagnac Effect, which is an optical phenomenon where light traveling in opposite directions through a coiled fiber experiences a phase shift when the system rotates. The key components include:\n\n\nCoiled Optical Fiber – Light is transmitted through several kilometers of fiber optic cable wound in a coil.\n\nLaser Source – A laser beam is split into two and sent in opposite directions through the fiber coil.\n\nInterference Detection – When the missile rotates, a phase shift occurs between the two light beams due to the Sagnac Effect, which is measured to determine angular velocity.\n\n\n\n\nWhy FOGs Are Used in Missile Navigation\n\n\nHigh Accuracy – FOGs provide precise rotational data, crucial for guiding missiles toward their targets.\n\nNo Moving Parts – Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, FOGs are solid-state, making them more reliable and durable.\n\nFast Response Time – Optical signals are processed almost instantly, allowing real-time adjustments to missile trajectory.\n\nResistant to External Disturbances – They are less affected by vibrations, accelerations, and electromagnetic interference, which are common in missile environments.\n\nLong Operational Life – Due to their solid-state nature, they have a longer lifespan and lower maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nApplication in Missile Systems\nFOGs are integrated into Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), which track a missile’s position without relying on external signals like GPS. This makes them especially useful in:\n\nBallistic Missiles – Ensuring precise long-range targeting.\nCruise Missiles – Providing accurate navigation for terrain-following and target-seeking.\nAir-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles – Enhancing mid-course and terminal guidance."

    "text": "Conversations in a Marriage\nWhen I was married, my Korean was at a level similar to a 귀환선교사.4.\nI was more comfortable speaking in English. But Sister K spoke only in Korean.\nAlthough I grew up in a Korean home, my language skills were limited to a vocabulary of a teenager speaking to parents\nOne of us had to learn quickly.\nHowever, what I needed was more than just verbal language improvement.\nI needed a whole suit of training on human relationship in a marriage.\n\nEmpathy and Understanding\nConflict Resolution\nAppreciation and Affection\nTrust & Honesty\nEffective Communication\n\nAfter 30+ years of a life lived together, I am beginning to be a better communicator, not necessarily because I am a better speaker of Korean or English.\n\nThinking it over, The Man from 長春 anticipated my questions and formulated his answer rather than actually hearing and understanding my pronunciations.\nWonder how often my parents and Sister K read the thoughts and intents of my mind and heart without exchanging words.\nI marvel how parents know the needs of a young or newborns without them uttering words or poorly formed words that others can’t understand.\nFurthermore, used to think that there will be a unifying language in next life.\nA Celestial Esperanto.5\nThat will finally put to rest, which of the many languages is closest to the one before the Tower of Babel.\n\n\nBased on the interaction with 長春的男子 and watching parents communicate with young ones, and my own married life, I am inclined to believe that there is a higher level of conversation.\nThe one without grammar or vocabulary. The one that is location independent or dialect-free.\nThat method of communication will be action based. With occasional confirmation, using our countenance, both as means of transmitting and receiving messages.\nAs we approach Zion Society, there will be less need for the current method of expressing ideas or giving commands via spoken words.\nThe bias will be towards action. There will be far less misunderstanding, since the result will be visible to all.\n\nNot that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\n\n\nKJV Matthew 15:11"

It had been relegated to basement duties for a year and 7 years in storage before that.\nIt brought momentary delight as well as anticipation of listening to 5 hours of 韓国歌曲 Korean Folk Songs.\nEven though most of these songs can be found on-line, it is nice to have one’s own copy.\nTo digitize and to utilize the number of cassette decks made by artisans during the decades of 1980s and 1990s.\nAnd to handle, feel and admire the workmanship and ingenuity that packs an hour of music into a 10.5 (L) x 7 (W) x 1.7 (H) mm bundle.\nIt has outer sleeve that has a 수채화 (水彩畫) or watercolor paiting on the front and the list of songs on the back, along with the composer of music, the author of lyrics, and the performer.\nThe cassette housing has an abbreviated song list, the manufacturer and the production date, 10 June 1985\nThere were 4 at the 답동\b지부, when our family was baptized.\nSimilar in age, within a grade or two in school, we all had 2 to 3 siblings.\nOur families formed the core of the Branch.\nThen 3 years later, our family moved to eastern US.\nShortly thereafter, J family moved to Seattle Area.\nBoth of us served missions stateside. Elder J in Chicago and I served in CLAM.\nLost contact with the 2 Lees that stayed in Korea.\nThen, one of the Lees came for his MBA at BYU.\nOnce he returned to Korea, we seldom spoke.\nThe other Lee came to the local Korean congregation that meets in Orem.\nWe met for a lunch.\nHe filled me in on those pioneering families of the 인천 仁川 area.\nHe also recounted the struggles and challenges of being a member in Korea. Along with businesses that failed.\nEventually he chose to migrate to US and settle in Richmond, VA.\nReached out to my friend J in Seattle, the one that is up-to-date on status of the 4 members from Incheon. He asked the MBA Lee if he can meet when we visit Korea.\nThe came back quickly and emphatically, YES!\nIt was delightful to hear his voice and plan our visit back that home of our youth/childhood. An anticipation of seeing old places of memories and hopes of meeting childhood friends and acquaintances.\nPerhaps, some of the themes in the Korean Lyrics/Folk Songs will be realized on this trip.\nLikewise I hope that the ways will be provided that will link and reunite families that were originally from North Korea.\nI hope to contact my extended families and we will mend our differences and create new memories\nBy talking of Christ and His Gospel and talk of families members that are no longer here.\nPartially fulfilling this verse in Revelation, Chapter 24."

That were confiscated by the communists, shortly after her father’s passing.\nNot being allowed to visit or correspond with loved ones for over 70 years.\nBut we carry that desire to return to our 본관(本貫), family origins.\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\nMy parents bore and overcame crushing disappoints in their lifetime.\nYet they found purpose and meaning in their lives through their inborn grit and faith and hope in Christ Jesus.\nThey waited for their Elder Brother to come and right the wrong.\nHowever, they left this life without realizing their hopes of liberation of a people and experiencing a reconciliation with their loved ones again.\nI hope to emulate some of that grit. That challenges, disappointments, and defeats are a part of this life.\nBut finding meaning and purpose that eminates from a simple song.\nThereby elevating thoughts and actions towards our Deliverer and the Day of Judgement.\nWhether collectively, the 2nd Coming, or individually, as our parents have shown.\n기럭 기럭 기럭이 북~에서 오고\n귀뚤 귀뚤 귀뚜라미 슬피울건만\n서울 가신 오빠는 소식도~ 없고\n나뭇잎만 우수수 떨~어~집니다."

    "text": "Open AI Explanation of Special Relativity\nThe difference in years for an astronaut traveling at near-light speed and then returning to Earth is explained by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, specifically Special Relativity and the concept of time dilation.\n\nKey Concept: Time Dilation\nTime dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers moving relative to each other. According to Einstein’s Special Relativity:\n\nAs an object moves faster, time slows down for it relative to an observer at rest.\nThe effect becomes dramatic as the object approaches the speed of light.\n\n\n\nThe Thought Experiment: The Twin Paradox\nImagine a twin astronaut traveling on a spaceship near the speed of light (say, 99.9% of the speed of light) and then returning to Earth.\n\nDuring the journey:\n\nThe astronaut’s clock (inside the spaceship) runs much slower compared to a clock on Earth.\nTo the astronaut, time feels normal, but for observers on Earth, the astronaut is aging much more slowly.\n\nWhen the astronaut returns to Earth:\n\nBecause time was moving slower for the astronaut, they may have aged only a few years.\nMeanwhile, much more time has passed on Earth—possibly decades or even centuries.\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nSpace and time are not absolute; they are interconnected in spacetime.\nHigh speeds cause space contraction and time dilation, effects predicted and confirmed by relativity.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf an astronaut were to travel at near-light speeds for what feels like a few years for them, they could return to Earth and find that many more years (even centuries) have passed here. This is a real effect and has been experimentally confirmed using high-speed particles and precise atomic clocks."

    "text": "M1 vs. M2 Money Supply: Key Differences and Impact on Inflation\nThe M1 and M2 money supplies both measure the amount of money circulating in an economy, but they focus on different types of liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between M1 and M2\n\n\nFeature\nM1\nM2\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nIncludes the most liquid forms of money.\nIncludes M1 plus less liquid savings instruments.\n\n\nComponents\nCurrency in circulation, checking accounts, Other liquid deposits\nEverything in M1, Savings Accounts, Money Market Accounts, Small Time Deposits (CDs under $100k)\n\n\nLiquidity\nHighly liquid (readily available for transactions)\nLess liquid (requires additional steps to access)\n\n\nPurpose\nUsed primarily for immediate spending.\nRepresents money that can be saved but is still accessible.\n\n\nVolatility\nMore volatile; reacts quickly to economic changes.\nMore stable; reflects longer-term savings behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on Inflation\n\nM1 and Inflation:\n\n\nA rapid increase in M1 often signals rising consumer spending, which can push demand higher and contribute to demand-pull inflation.\nConversely, a sharp decrease in M1 may reflect reduced spending power, which can slow economic growth.\n\n\nM2 and Inflation:\n\n\nGrowth in M2 is more closely linked to longer-term inflation trends since it reflects both spending and savings behavior.\nA sharp rise in M2 may indicate excess liquidity, which can eventually spill into consumer prices.\n\n\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nIf the Federal Reserve increases the money supply (M1) rapidly, consumers may spend more, driving up demand for goods and services. Without an increase in supply, this can raise prices, causing inflation.\nOn the other hand, a spike in M2 might show that people are saving more, potentially delaying inflation but signaling future spending capacity.\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\nM1 is a better short-term indicator of spending patterns.\nM2 provides a broader view of money growth and its potential long-term impact on inflation.\n\n\n\n\nM1 Supply and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nFrom Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis\n\nM1 Supply (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (CPIAUCSL) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes M1 Money Supply Predict Inflation or Vice Versa\nThe M1 money supply and inflation are closely linked, but the relationship is complex — one does not always predict the other in a straightforward way. Here’s how the interaction generally works:\n\n1. M1 Growth as a Predictor of Inflation\n\nM1 Expansion → Inflation Risk:\n\nWhen the M1 supply rises rapidly, it often signals increased consumer spending. If demand outpaces the supply of goods and services, demand-pull inflation can occur.\nExample: During economic stimulus periods, expanded M1 may lead to higher prices if consumer spending surges.\n\n✅ M1 growth tends to lead inflation — but only if spending activity rises faster than supply.\n\n\n2. Inflation Influencing M1\n\nInflation → Higher M1 Demand:\n\nIn inflationary periods, consumers may keep more funds in liquid forms (like checking accounts) to cope with rising prices, which can inflate M1 figures.\nExample: In times of high inflation, people may reduce savings in long-term deposits (M2) and instead hold more cash or liquid assets (M1) to maintain spending flexibility.\n\n✅ Inflation can increase M1 as people adjust financial habits.\n\n\n3. Situations Where the Link Breaks\n\nVelocity of Money: If M1 rises but money velocity (the rate money circulates in the economy) falls, inflation may not follow.\nSupply Chain Factors: Inflation can also spike due to supply-side shocks (e.g., oil crises, labor shortages) without direct M1 changes.\n\n\n\nHistorical Example:\n\n2020–2021 (Pandemic Stimulus Era):\nThe U.S. M1 supply surged due to stimulus payments and loose monetary policy.\nInitially, inflation remained low because consumers saved more and spent cautiously.\nBy late 2021, when spending increased, inflation spiked sharply.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nM1 growth is often a leading indicator of inflation, but its predictive power depends on consumer behavior, economic conditions, and supply-side factors.\nInflation can also reshape M1 patterns as people shift toward more liquid assets"

    "text": "📜 Background and Cultural Context\n\n🔹 1. Preference for Sons\nIn traditional Korean (and broader East Asian) society:\n\nSons were preferred for carrying on the family name, ancestral rites, and economic support.\nFamilies hoping for a son might name a first-born daughter with a masculine name as a kind of “placeholder” or luck-bringing gesture to bring about the birth of a son next.\n\n\nExample: Naming a girl “Sang-chul” (상철), a name typical for boys, to trick spirits or fate.\n\n\n\n\n🔹 2. Protective Naming: “Misnaming”\nThere was also a superstitious belief that evil spirits could target or harm precious children. By giving a girl a boy’s name or a rough/common name:\n\nThe child might avoid spiritual attention or harm.\nIt would protect the child’s life and future.\n\nThis overlaps with similar practices in other cultures (e.g., Russian peasants giving babies “ugly” names to ward off spirits).\n\n\n\n🔹 3. Practical Effects\nSome women continued using their masculine names legally or socially for decades. You’ll find:\n\nWomen born in the 1930s–60s with names like Young-ho, Dong-soo, or Chul-soo.\nOccasionally, feminine names with strong, masculine syllables (like Sun-chul, Jong-il) that were family-chosen rather than self-selected.\n\n\n\n\n🔹 4. Decline of the Practice\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, this tradition has largely faded:\n\nChanging gender norms\nDecline in son preference\nRise of gender-neutral or Western-inspired Korean names like Ji-min, Ji-woo, Ha-eun"

In 1995, approximately 26.8% of vehicles sold at CarMax featured manual transmissions. In 2018 that figure dropped to 3.7%\nThere has been a resurgence driven by younger drivers seeking a more engaging driving experience and a sense of nostalgia along with enthusiasts that continue to seek them out for the control and driving pleasure they offer.2\nLearned to drive a stick shift on streets of El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula,\nBecause Koreans were scattered throughout the mission and some outside the county, we were given an car, with an automatic transmission - A Chevrolet Chevette3.\nInitially, my senior companion, with 6 months remaining, drove exclusively around K-Town as well as many locations that required freeway driving.\nThere was another set of Korean-speaking elders that covered the south half of the mission, that is mainly LA county and some of the Orange county.\nThey also had a Chevette but their tan version had a manual transmission.\nElder C from Hawaii suggested I learn how to drive it.\nNo pre-training, we just drove around the streets of Bellflower and Norwalk and hoped I would learn.\nIn the beginning, stalled out the engine due to improper timing between the clutch pedal and the stick shift.\nBut after making a few drivers upset along the Rosecrans Avenue, I got the hang of it.\nDidn’t have a car during college years.\nGoing back to college, as a graduate student, my parents bought a car for me.\nOpted for a Subaru Station Wagon, a DL model with a 4WD, well suited for Utah.\nThe car served me well with its ample cargo space, when 2nd row seats were folded down.\nHowever when Sister K married me, she didn’t know how to drive a manual transmission.\nGave an effort to teach her but I was not as efficient nor patient as Elder C.\nWe didn’t get very far, Sister K enlisted help of a her friend and she could drive the Subaru while I was at school.\nWhen we bought, with help from our parents, a Mercury Villager, Sister K was elated.\nShe could take children to school and was free from the clutch and stick routine.\nMuch like the Artificial Intelligence aided, enabled understanding and task completion, the essential part of growth and learning has been eliminated.\nThese days, it is difficult to kill an engine while driving.\nEven if one was able to override the algorithm and take a bad shot, it would be difficult to pin-point what contributed to photos being out of focus.\nThat agency or choice is not available in press-button photo taking and AI generated answers.\nIn taking or making photos, like in other efforts in life, mistakes will be made.\nIn those mistakes, lessons are given and learned.\nThe gentleman that sold me the Nikon camera said,\n9 months into owning the camera, there are buttons, settings and mirrors that I haven’t used.\nSeveral times, I was tempted to use the automatic mode.\nSadly Nikon doesn’t provide that mode, closest mode is the Aperture Mode.\nI had to learn, or re-learn, the inter-relationship of the aperture opening, shutter speed and the light sensitivity as measured in ISO.4\nPhotos taken with this camera has a number of flaws.\nBut it represents the reality better.\nThat is, it matches what my eyes sees better than the cell phone logic generated photos.\nLearned for myself, rather than pursuing skills and equipment to make photos like those of the professionals, make a photo or record of your own experience.\nIf the goal or the pursuit is to understand how light is captured and processed, then purchase a used DSLR and go take pictures of unique offerings in the neighborhood"
