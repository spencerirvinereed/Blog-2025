    "text": "Open AI Explanation of Special Relativity\nThe difference in years for an astronaut traveling at near-light speed and then returning to Earth is explained by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, specifically Special Relativity and the concept of time dilation.\n\nKey Concept: Time Dilation\nTime dilation means that time passes at different rates for observers moving relative to each other. According to Einstein’s Special Relativity:\n\nAs an object moves faster, time slows down for it relative to an observer at rest.\nThe effect becomes dramatic as the object approaches the speed of light.\n\n\n\nThe Thought Experiment: The Twin Paradox\nImagine a twin astronaut traveling on a spaceship near the speed of light (say, 99.9% of the speed of light) and then returning to Earth.\n\nDuring the journey:\n\nThe astronaut’s clock (inside the spaceship) runs much slower compared to a clock on Earth.\nTo the astronaut, time feels normal, but for observers on Earth, the astronaut is aging much more slowly.\n\nWhen the astronaut returns to Earth:\n\nBecause time was moving slower for the astronaut, they may have aged only a few years.\nMeanwhile, much more time has passed on Earth—possibly decades or even centuries.\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nSpace and time are not absolute; they are interconnected in spacetime.\nHigh speeds cause space contraction and time dilation, effects predicted and confirmed by relativity.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf an astronaut were to travel at near-light speeds for what feels like a few years for them, they could return to Earth and find that many more years (even centuries) have passed here. This is a real effect and has been experimentally confirmed using high-speed particles and precise atomic clocks."

That were confiscated by the communists, shortly after her father’s passing.\nNot being allowed to visit or correspond with loved ones for over 70 years.\nBut we carry that desire to return to our 본관(本貫), family origins.\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\nMy parents bore and overcame crushing disappoints in their lifetime.\nYet they found purpose and meaning in their lives through their inborn grit and faith and hope in Christ Jesus.\nThey waited for their Elder Brother to come and right the wrong.\nHowever, they left this life without realizing their hopes of liberation of a people and experiencing a reconciliation with their loved ones again.\nI hope to emulate some of that grit. Realizing that challenges, disappointments, and defeats are a part of this life.\nBut finding meaning and purpose that eminates from a simple song.\nThereby elevating thoughts and actions towards our Deliverer and the Day of Judgement.\nWhether collectively, the 2nd Coming, or individually, as our parents have shown.\n기럭 기럭 기럭이 북~에서 오고\n귀뚤 귀뚤 귀뚜라미 슬피울건만\n서울 가신 오빠는 소식도~ 없고\n나뭇잎만 우수수 떨~어~집니다."

The time spent in writing can be used to improve lives of others, which in turn improves your life.\nCan you think of instances where followers wrote down teachings of the master?\n손자/孫子\nLet’s see. (using AI Prompts)\nQuite a lot.\nOlder Me\nLikewise, my parents didn’t write much. They were busy making a living and doing good to others.\nSo it is fitting that those of us that benefited most write a little.\n손자/孫子\nThat is a good motivation.\nWhere should I begin, I don’t know much without the AI support.\nOlder Me\nExodus 20:12\nBegin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.\nIf fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life."

He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.\nAs the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together.

Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,\n“How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?”\nSocrates smiled and replied,\n“If only you could see how much room there is for my friends.”\nThe man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\n“A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds.”\nAt that moment, a group of Socrates’ friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us.\nShe summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends\n\nNext topic was,\nDoes my action align with my values?\nWhat can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.\n\nThink celestially\nWe can’t live unto ourselves\nGet proximate to people who are suffering\nPractice holy envy\n\nWe learned about Joseph Millett\n\n\nThe Story of Joseph Millett\nJoseph Millett was a poor pioneer farmer who lived in the late 1800s. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to give the man some flour from his own supply.\nThat evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:\n\n“Another poor man came for flour today, and I gave him some of the last I had. I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I could not let him go hungry.”\n\nHe then added:\n\n“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, which gave us enough to buy more flour.”\n\nJoseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.\nThe faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.\n\nBy the lesson’s end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.\nThe teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.\nBut extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.\n\nThe level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.\nI think,\n\nit cannot get better than this\n\nBut it does.\nThe church and its people are growing.\nAnd in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well."

    "text": "There aren’t many surnames in Korea.\nAccording to Open-AI, GPT, there are approximately 280 family names.\nHowever, top 3 names, Kim, Lee, and Park account for nearly half of the population (~45%).\nGPT further explains,\n\nMany surnames are distinguished by their bon-gwan (본관, 本貫), which indicates the ancestral hometown or clan origin. This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname\n\nSo the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.\n\nOur family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.\nI have not seen my father’s family record or 계보(系譜).\nI don’t know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.\nI do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.\nMany families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.\nAlso I recall that my grandfather’s mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather’s name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.\nBased on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.\n\nIt is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.\nBoth of my parent’s family added to those figures. All of my father’s siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother’s sisters.\nI still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.\nThat distinctive sound is no longer common.\nBut every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father’s home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father’s hometown of 안변.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy father’s hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.\nIf a way opens up, I would travel to .\n한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47\nWhen I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father’s older brother’s (강금섭) graves.\n\nMy mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)\nShe was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.\nAlthough she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.\n\nOver the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.\nNow that hope is fading.\nMeanwhile, I will follow this teaching\n\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Luke 3:8 (KJV)\n\nAlso, I will do my best to record things that I remember. Things my parents told me about their recollections.\nI hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.\n\nProvo, March 2025\n\n\nUnderstanding Bon-gwan\n\nThe bon-gwan system helps distinguish families with the same surname.\nPeople with the same surname and bon-gwan are considered part of the same extended family and traditionally cannot marry each other.\n\n\n\nNotable Kang Bon-gwan\nSome prominent Kang clans include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBon-gwan (본관)\nRegion (Location)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nJinju (진주 강씨)\nJinju, South Gyeongsang\nOne of the largest Kang clans\n\n\nGoksan (곡산 강씨)\nGoksan, North Hwanghae (now in North Korea)\nHistorically influential in politics\n\n\nNaju (나주 강씨)\nNaju, South Jeolla\nKnown for scholars and officials\n\n\nCheongju (청주 강씨)\nCheongju, North Chungcheong\nSmaller but historically significant\n\n\nAndong (안동 강씨)\nAndong, North Gyeongsang\nKnown for Confucian scholars"

Only one who could explain the meaning didn’t speak our language.\nWe were stuck.\nOnly solution was to send our associates, who would work with their associates. Be trained on the work to be done.\nEveryone involved was in agreement. Only difference to be resolved was length of the training period. We were off by factor of nearly 20.\nJapanese team suggested multiple years. Our team thought few weeks was sufficient.\nWe settled at 6 weeks of training.\nWhich side was more accurate, the time will confirm.\n\nIn the intervening years.\nGradual translation has transformed to instant, AI assisted conversion.

He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.\nOne day, he demands his share of the inheritance early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake moves to the city, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.\nFor a while, Jake feels on top of the world, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling. Desperate, he looks for work but has no real job experience.\nHe remembers how good life was at home—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.\nSwallowing his pride, Jake calls his father, expecting rejection. Instead, his father rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him like nothing ever happened. “Welcome home, son,” he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, “You were lost, but now you’re found.”\nJake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. “I worked hard while he wasted everything.

But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”\n\nJake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.\nWe will also be on that train, albeit at different times and travelling at different speed.\nTo the same destination.\nSomeday we will be with him, that model shown by those that preceded us.\nThat spiritual home in this life.\nWhere we are first loved and receive all that our parents have.\nWe in turn, learn how to love, how to give to the next generation.\nGladys Knight & The Pips\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0F9lh8TiSM"

The remaining diving board base served as a roping practice tool on P-Days.\nOn the plus side, we were a few blocks away from the center of K-Town. Olympic and Western was the unofficial gateway into the Korean enclave.\nIn addition, the famous El Chollo restaurant was on Western Avenue. We also had Chinese Restaurants, the kind we grew up with in Korea. To busy Angelinos, these restaurants became a common meeting place.\nBut the biggest challenge was gaining the trust of members. They welcomed me as their own, but they questioned my language ability.\nSo did I.\nI spoke to my siblings in English. I did speak to my parents in Korean but it was at a grade school level. Outside of home and few Korean members and returned missionaries, had no other contact with Koreans growing up in Maryland.\nSome members even asked whether I was really Korean Since no Korean would lack the language skills as I did. They thought my trainer, who spent 9 months in Korea before transferring to LA, spoke far better Korean.\nI had work to do.\nWorked hard to overcome my fears of speaking in front of people. By meeing people on the streets and at their homes, language comprehension improved. We had some success as well.\nThen my companion of 7 months completed his mission and returned home.\nI was not ready for what was about to happen.\nI was entrusted with 2 missionaries, directly from MTC. One was from Gilbert AZ, the other from Richland WA. I went from one being trained to training new missionaries – 2 of them.\nI was at loss at first. But I no option but to carry on. With their faith, support of family at home and members of the Korean Branch the continued.\nI got to visit each apartment in Koreatown at least twice, some many more times.\nI trained 2 more companions before finishing my mission. 2 Elder 박, one from Chicago and the other from Ogden.\nThus by putting faith in God, I was strengthened. As promised in Ether 12.\nThe language improvement was made gradually without compulsory means."

Here’s a summary:\n\nAbraham’s Mission for His Servant\nAbraham, now old, wanted his son Isaac to marry someone from his homeland rather than a Canaanite woman. So, he sent his most trusted servant (traditionally thought to be Eliezer) to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor, where his relatives lived. He made the servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s own people and not from the local Canaanites.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Prayer for Guidance\nWhen the servant arrived at a well outside the city, he prayed to God for a sign. He asked that when he asked a young woman for a drink of water, she would not only give him water but also offer to draw water for his camels. This, he believed, would be a sign that she was the right wife for Isaac.\n\n\nRebekah’s Kindness and God’s Sign\nBefore the servant even finished his prayer, Rebekah—the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother, Nahor—came to the well. When the servant asked her for a drink, she eagerly gave him water and also offered to draw water for his camels, just as he had prayed! Since camels can drink a lot, this act showed her kindness, generosity, and hardworking nature.\n\n\nThe Servant’s Confirmation and Gifts\nAmazed, the servant asked who she was. When he learned she was from Abraham’s family, he bowed and thanked God for guiding him. He then gave Rebekah gold jewelry as gifts.\n\n\nRebekah’s Family Approves the Marriage\nThe servant went to Rebekah’s home and explained his mission to her family. Her brother Laban and her father Bethuel agreed that this was God’s will and allowed Rebekah to go with the servant to marry Isaac. Rebekah herself agreed, showing her faith and willingness to follow this destiny.\n\n\nRebekah and Isaac’s Marriage\nRebekah traveled back with the servant to Canaan. When Isaac saw her, he took her into his mother Sarah’s tent and married her. The Bible says he loved her, and she became a comfort to him after his mother’s death.\nThis story highlights faith, divine guidance, and the importance of character in choosing a life partner. Would you like a deeper analysis or a retelling in a different style?"

Those who flee the family flee the world; bereft of the [family’s] affection, tutelage, and challenges, they are unprepared for the [world’s] tests, judgments, and demands” (The Moral Sense [1993], 163).\n\nHow ironical that some go “into a far country” (Luke 15:13), leaving the nourishing family garden—in which there may be some weeds—and go into a desert with its tumbling sagebrush.\n\nLike serving a mission, in my family no one talked about it to me, I certainly wasn’t pressured.\nHaving an idyllic time at a large university, where it was talked about but never forced.\nThough when I turned 25, people in passing used the menace, as in\n&gt; A menace to a society\nBit strong, a person or thing that is likely to cause harm; a threat or danger.\n—\nGrateful for professors and students at BYU for teaching me how to conduct myself.\nHow free society functions, no compulsion, right principles.\nThose members in the BYU 1st Stake that taught me how to live a life in the gospel.\n\nMy training consisted of my family.\nWatching other families in the church.\nTeaching people of LA in their homes and getting a glimpse of a married life.\nSpent a summer reading about the Eternal Marriage.\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/35311_eng.pdf\n(found out later that Sister K read the same manual)\n\nAlong with the conversion to the gospel.\nConversion to the marriage is an on-going effort.\nNo certificate is required, given at a time when two people of understanding years, make a commitment to be together and raise a family together.\nCan’t think of more wonderful show of faith.\nPersonal commitment, made in front of others.\nCase of private commitment that is shared publicly\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) is a crucial component in missile navigation systems, providing highly accurate angular velocity measurements to ensure precise guidance and control. Here’s how it works and why it’s used:\n\nHow a FOG Works\nA Fiber Optic Gyroscope operates based on the Sagnac Effect, which is an optical phenomenon where light traveling in opposite directions through a coiled fiber experiences a phase shift when the system rotates. The key components include:\n\n\nCoiled Optical Fiber – Light is transmitted through several kilometers of fiber optic cable wound in a coil.\n\nLaser Source – A laser beam is split into two and sent in opposite directions through the fiber coil.\n\nInterference Detection – When the missile rotates, a phase shift occurs between the two light beams due to the Sagnac Effect, which is measured to determine angular velocity.\n\n\n\n\nWhy FOGs Are Used in Missile Navigation\n\n\nHigh Accuracy – FOGs provide precise rotational data, crucial for guiding missiles toward their targets.\n\nNo Moving Parts – Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, FOGs are solid-state, making them more reliable and durable.\n\nFast Response Time – Optical signals are processed almost instantly, allowing real-time adjustments to missile trajectory.\n\nResistant to External Disturbances – They are less affected by vibrations, accelerations, and electromagnetic interference, which are common in missile environments.\n\nLong Operational Life – Due to their solid-state nature, they have a longer lifespan and lower maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\n\nApplication in Missile Systems\nFOGs are integrated into Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), which track a missile’s position without relying on external signals like GPS. This makes them especially useful in:\n\nBallistic Missiles – Ensuring precise long-range targeting.\nCruise Missiles – Providing accurate navigation for terrain-following and target-seeking.\nAir-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles – Enhancing mid-course and terminal guidance."

    "text": "M1 vs. M2 Money Supply: Key Differences and Impact on Inflation\nThe M1 and M2 money supplies both measure the amount of money circulating in an economy, but they focus on different types of liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between M1 and M2\n\n\nFeature\nM1\nM2\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nIncludes the most liquid forms of money.\nIncludes M1 plus less liquid savings instruments.\n\n\nComponents\nCurrency in circulation, checking accounts, Other liquid deposits\nEverything in M1, Savings Accounts, Money Market Accounts, Small Time Deposits (CDs under $100k)\n\n\nLiquidity\nHighly liquid (readily available for transactions)\nLess liquid (requires additional steps to access)\n\n\nPurpose\nUsed primarily for immediate spending.\nRepresents money that can be saved but is still accessible.\n\n\nVolatility\nMore volatile; reacts quickly to economic changes.\nMore stable; reflects longer-term savings behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on Inflation\n\nM1 and Inflation:\n\n\nA rapid increase in M1 often signals rising consumer spending, which can push demand higher and contribute to demand-pull inflation.\nConversely, a sharp decrease in M1 may reflect reduced spending power, which can slow economic growth.\n\n\nM2 and Inflation:\n\n\nGrowth in M2 is more closely linked to longer-term inflation trends since it reflects both spending and savings behavior.\nA sharp rise in M2 may indicate excess liquidity, which can eventually spill into consumer prices.\n\n\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nIf the Federal Reserve increases the money supply (M1) rapidly, consumers may spend more, driving up demand for goods and services. Without an increase in supply, this can raise prices, causing inflation.\nOn the other hand, a spike in M2 might show that people are saving more, potentially delaying inflation but signaling future spending capacity.\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\nM1 is a better short-term indicator of spending patterns.\nM2 provides a broader view of money growth and its potential long-term impact on inflation.\n\n\n\n\nM1 Supply and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nFrom Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis\n\nM1 Supply (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (CPIAUCSL) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes M1 Money Supply Predict Inflation or Vice Versa\nThe M1 money supply and inflation are closely linked, but the relationship is complex — one does not always predict the other in a straightforward way. Here’s how the interaction generally works:\n\n1. M1 Growth as a Predictor of Inflation\n\nM1 Expansion → Inflation Risk:\n\nWhen the M1 supply rises rapidly, it often signals increased consumer spending. If demand outpaces the supply of goods and services, demand-pull inflation can occur.\nExample: During economic stimulus periods, expanded M1 may lead to higher prices if consumer spending surges.\n\n✅ M1 growth tends to lead inflation — but only if spending activity rises faster than supply.\n\n\n2. Inflation Influencing M1\n\nInflation → Higher M1 Demand:\n\nIn inflationary periods, consumers may keep more funds in liquid forms (like checking accounts) to cope with rising prices, which can inflate M1 figures.\nExample: In times of high inflation, people may reduce savings in long-term deposits (M2) and instead hold more cash or liquid assets (M1) to maintain spending flexibility.\n\n✅ Inflation can increase M1 as people adjust financial habits.\n\n\n3. Situations Where the Link Breaks\n\nVelocity of Money: If M1 rises but money velocity (the rate money circulates in the economy) falls, inflation may not follow.\nSupply Chain Factors: Inflation can also spike due to supply-side shocks (e.g., oil crises, labor shortages) without direct M1 changes.\n\n\n\nHistorical Example:\n\n2020–2021 (Pandemic Stimulus Era):\nThe U.S. M1 supply surged due to stimulus payments and loose monetary policy.\nInitially, inflation remained low because consumers saved more and spent cautiously.\nBy late 2021, when spending increased, inflation spiked sharply.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nM1 growth is often a leading indicator of inflation, but its predictive power depends on consumer behavior, economic conditions, and supply-side factors.\nInflation can also reshape M1 patterns as people shift toward more liquid assets"
