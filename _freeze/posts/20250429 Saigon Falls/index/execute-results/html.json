A quest for freedom, a place to call home, and a chance to improve the living standard.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThough I have not visited South America I had the opportunity of meeting and working with people from Perú, Colombia, and Brazil all within the same company.\n\nIn addition I have met people from Bulgaria and Iran and number of people that have served their missions in countries that speak Spanish, Chinese Mandarin and Swedish among others\n\nRecently coworker moved into the same building and we visited over our common interest – audio equipment.\n\nHe is a fan of Nakamichi any particular Nelson Pass[^2]designed equipment.\n\n[^2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Pass?oldformat=true>\n\nWe also shared a mutual affinity to analog records.\n\nThen he mention that he came over from Australia in 1992\n\nAlso,he told he was from Vietnam, in particular from south Vietnam. He was from a wealthy family but when the communist took over 50 years ago, in April 1975 his family was devastated and they look for ways to escape.\n\nUsing their reserve of gold they got on a boat and endured 2 weeks of travel through Malaysia, Singapore and eventually to a small off the main islands of Indonesia.\n\nRefugees were then interviewed by representatives from countries that took in the `Boat People` According to Wikipedia, significant numbers resettled in the United States, Canada, Italy, Australia, France, West Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever my friend settled in Australia and lived for a decade before moving to the United States.\n\n## Journey of Lao\n\nthat took up to Malaysia from there they went to Singapore from Singapore on to Indonesia it from Indonesia they went to Australia and to help with their family he went came tonight states since my father also lived and worked in Vietnam share some of his old photographs that I had on my phone what brings people to Utah them here\n\n500 miles : Vietnam to Malaysia 400 miles : Malaysia to Singapore 250 miles : Singapore to Bangka Islands\n\nHis boat journey took nearly 2 weeks.\n\nStarting at Can Tho\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load leaflet\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Coordinates for central Saigon (District 1 area)\nlat <- 10.04432637972083\nlng <- 105.74726945658837\n\n# Create map\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Default OpenStreetMap tiles\n  setView(lng = lng, lat = lat, zoom = 10) %>%\n  addMarkers(lng = lng, lat = lat, popup = \"Cần Thơ, Vietnam\") %>%\n  addCircles(lng = lng, lat = lat, radius = 500, color = \"red\", fillOpacity = 0.2,\n             popup = \"Set on the southern bank of the Hau River\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-3a2fd074d86425ba19a1\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-3a2fd074d86425ba19a1\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy;
