One exception was a visit to 동물원 (動物園).\n\n## A Trip to 김해\n\nMy dad's youngest sibling, who was 13 years younger, lived with us. My mom and he made a pact.\n\nAs long as he passed the entrance exams, my parents would fund his education.\n\nHowever, my parents ran into a difficult stretch financially. My mom suggested he take a break from study and volunteer for a military service.\n\n(military service in those days were not mandatory)\n\nUnderstanding the family situation, my uncle volunteered.\n\nEither due to his exam taking skills or propensity for studying, he earned a family visit credit.\n\nAt the time he was stationed at 김해공명학교, performing civil engineering duties within the military.\n\nThe distance from 인천 to 김해 is about 500 km.\n\nI imagine trains in those days traveled about 50km per hour. But I remember my mother and I visited the youngest brother of my father.\n\nDuring his military service, the service rendered because of financial struggles.\n\n![Uncle after the military service](images/EPSON019-EDIT.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow I live in an era where I am reminded what Maximally Achievable Life looks like and ways I can achieve it.\n\nI am grateful that life's essentials are granted by virtue of being a citizen of developed nations of the world.\n\nThat the freedom of expression is not limited,\n\n> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nA gratitude to my parents for demonstrating how to live in a times of plenty and of famine.\n\nGod-centered, frugal, family-centered life.\n\n-   Memorial Day, 2025\n\n![](images/20250515_113048.jpg)\n\nIn the **1960s**, the percentage of Christians in **South Korea** was relatively small but growing rapidly.
