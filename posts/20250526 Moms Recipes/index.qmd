Mom's family were coordinators.

Taste coordinators, to be exact.

Her grandmother would be called on to coordinate the taste of the food for upcoming celebration

To make the food, often made without the aid of recipes, taste as if a single person created it was a feat.

Likewise, my mom didn't use recipes.

Her food just tasted right.

Later she kept a journal of food recipe along with some sayings

Her first dated entry begins on 26 January 2013

A month or so prior to her 81st birthday and 10 years prior to her passing.
