I have not met my grandfather on both sides.

All of the family traditions and associated stories I learned through my 2 grandmothers and my parents.

Through my grandmothers, who both became widows in their 30s, I learned perseverance.
Their persistence was complimented by their faith in Jesus Christ.

Because of their examples, both my father and mother was raised in Christian principles.

I wonder how they survived, as a single parent, raising 5 children after the war.

They gave there all and provided a foundation of faith for their children

Both my parents became effective head of the household as a teenager.

Wonder how they learned to negotiate in the society?
How many people were kind to them or did they take advantage because of their age?

Summarize their life as grit and commitment.

What will be the legacy?

Continue the Christian life that my parents led.

Grateful they were committed to living a life for us.
