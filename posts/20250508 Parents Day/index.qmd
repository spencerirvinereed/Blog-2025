Thought about the family legacy.

We do not have a family record, beyond grand fathers, Í∞ïÌòÑÏö© on my father's side. And great grandfather Ìô©ÎßåÏàò on my mother's side.

I have not met both Grandfather Í∞ïÌòÑÏö© nor Grandfather Ìô©Ïö¥Ìïô. There are no known photographs of them.

However, I would recognize them.

Aside from their physical appearance, I can predict their mannerism, especially the way they speak. And it would confirm that I inherited many of my views on life, both here and hereafter, from them.

For their lives and the persona were transmitting through stories about them and how their children lived their teachings.

I would surmise that one was a devoted husband, loving father, spiritual, entrepreneurial. The other cared for the things of this life more than the spiritual.

The friends and work took precedence over the family matters. His talent in singing and good looks meant he was in demand. And that gathering often involved alcohol and ended with some type of game of wager.

The one was able to build a small yet thriving enterprise in his early 30s. The other lived a life similar to a song by the Temptations, called `Papa was a Rolling Stone`.

Establishing and maintaining a home, a foundation of both physical and spiritual, is the role of parents.

My parents came from homes with a different level of a foundation. However, they were both

> ...taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days,

1 Nephi 1

They were able to forge a living, stay true to their belief, find a way to a new world and teach about this life and the life eternal.

So I wlll follow the admonition of the Prophet Nephi

> nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

And also remember the goodness and sacrifices of my progenitors.

Thank you Mom and Dad.
