For the first time in a long while, decided to join a large, outside gathering of people.

When young at heart, and had young ones and older people with us, we attended nearly every year.

Some participants would stake out a spot along the route nearly 24 hours before the event.

I didn't see a need for it.

However, a friend that camped out near the North 2nd Street, invited us to join. On the east side of the main thoroughfare. East side because that side is shaded longer than the other side.

The young ones took couches and tables and set up an onâ€“the-street version of the video game matchup.

It is one event where multi-generational participants can find something of interest.

If friends and families were in town, they were automatically invited and participated.

One year, Sister K's sister's family, Sister K's mom and dad and Sister K's Grandmother Song came and witnessed.

We broke maximum passenger capacity of a minivan, due to parking scarcity.

This year, I casually walked up, after the parade started.

Went down towards the end of the parade route, so that I wouln't miss any.\^\[the parade begins on the University (Main) Avenue that is a North-South avenue, then turns into the Center Street which is a East-West street\]

I was alone today.

The crowd was gathered, mostly in groups of families

They brought chairs, awnings, tents, and whatever made them more comfortable.

Childrens faces were painted in red and blue, and matching ribbons adorned their hair.

The East-West street not only had the advantage of being near the end of the parade but it also has mature trees like American Sycamore that provides provides ample shading.

By not camping out and not having a chair to sit on, meant I was going to stand up for the duration of the parade.

But I had the energy and the curiosity to do so.

I enjoyed walking around to different vantage points and occasionally checking in to the scene to get a photographic image.

In the past I tried to get as much of the scene as possible.

I focused on individual efforts.

No family members participated in the parade

But I saw fellow citizens and neighbors, driving, shooting water guns and passed by as elected officials.

One drove a century old car, Ford Model A as part of a enthusiast club

Another pulled a water wagon for the high school band that my children played in.

The third, as an elected official, representing the citizens of a district, earned a right to ride in an elevated fire engine and shoot water gun at participants.

The parade was entertaining and brought back memories and feelings of joy and gratitude.

It had accomplished its purpose.

Then I began to compare.

-   Were parades in the past better organized, more band members, better floats.

-   Did I grow (old) up or had parade changed.

Like many events in life, there were far more observers in this parade.

As an observer, my preparation and participation level has decreased over the years.

This year I took what I wanted to capture and remember from the Freedom Festival Main Parade.

Consumed what others had prepared for months or even years and made a quick, on the spot judgment

I need to judge less and participate more.

Then perhaps the understanding will come.

-   Why we need public parades.

-   What will my life's parade consist of

-   What are plans and implementations of my current and for future private parades

Thank you citizens of the Utah Valley, the young and old.

For preparing and participating in the parade, reminding that life rewards according to our efforts.

At times alone and some in unison with our neighbors.
