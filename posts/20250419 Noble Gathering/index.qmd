The local Recreation Center hosted a 2-hour event.

It was held at the same location, where Seniors gather.

Participants arrived, dressed appropriately for the event.

Men in formal attire, with ties.

Women in dresses of various styles and colors.

It was a Daddy Daughter Dance event.

Turmoils and uncertainties are ever present and are part of modern life.

-   What makes a strong country?
-   A thriving community?

It begins with a family.

Women that will raise up a strong and compassionate leaders. And Men who knew priorities in life

Noble men and women of Provo, thank you for your example.

> It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses.
