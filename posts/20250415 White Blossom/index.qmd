> 桜を見ましたか？

During travels to Japan, locals and hosts often asked if I had seen cherry trees blossom.

Having grown up in Washington DC, knew a little about it.

I used to wonder,

> Why 桜花, aren't there other trees that blossom?

Regrettably, our travel plans didn't align with nature's flowring cycles and we were either too early by months or late by weeks.

One of the advantages of staying in small towns along the **Tōkaidō** **東海道 east sea way, is a chance to witness a local festivals or matsuris.**

> **The Tōkaidō was once Japan’s most important road, connecting the capital of Edo with the imperial seat of Kyoto. It was used by daimyō and samurai going to the capital along with merchants and commoners on pilgrimages. \^\[**[https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g02415/#:\~:text=The%20T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D%20was%20once%20Japan's,merchants%20and%20commoners%20on%20pilgrimages.](https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g02415/#:~:text=The%20T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D%20was%20once%20Japan's,merchants%20and%20commoners%20on%20pilgrimages.)\]

City of Iwata\^\[<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Iwata,_Shizuoka>\] re-enacted the passing of entourage during the Edo Era.

Many came, including families came, and judging by the pro-level camera equipment, this was to be a serious effort.

Citizens of Iwata didn't disappoint.

The city also has a botanical garden

These sites were a station away on the Tokaido Main Line or 1 to 2 miles from the work at Fukuroi.

We had a typical spring in Utah.

Warm summer like days followed by a spring snow storm.

Curtains to outside was closed.

On Sunday, we opened the curtain and were greeted by a full blossom of the cherry tree.

Whether we recognize or follow the nature's cycle, it is busy at work.

Rather than chasing the location, be in sync with it wherever one is called to labor in.
