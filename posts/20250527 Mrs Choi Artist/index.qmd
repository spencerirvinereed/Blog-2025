We met with Ms. C, she had recently moved from NYC to LA.

Her friend introduced us to her.

She was an artist, a painter of modernized Korean themes, using watercolor paintings

She told us, she was reluctant to bring children into the world.

With all the negatives surrounding them.

As a new missionary and with no real world experience, I had no response

Now that I have lived several decades and have had children of my own.

Also watching my children raising the next generation, I have a response.

The parents of this generation is remarkable.
