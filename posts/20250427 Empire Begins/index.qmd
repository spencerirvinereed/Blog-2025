Took a visit to a coastal city about 600 miles to the west

While waiting for the plane, met 3 sets of friends

A young man in the neighborhood

A co-worker, Spencer Wong

A former Mission President.

Was offered a ticket to the SF Giants game.

We passed it on to our son and we dined nearby

The room was filled with 4 families and each family had 4 children.

It was chaotic and organized at the same time.

Behold, their [husbands](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7a) [love](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7b) their [wives](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7c), and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children;

Jacob 3:7

One side of their large living room was covered with family photos.

Indeed wealthy
