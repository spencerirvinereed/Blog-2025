> the Empire Builder Train narrative

Took a visit to a coastal city about 680 miles to the south of the western terminus of the Empire Builder Line.

That city was also featured in the Disney animation, Big Hero 6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

While waiting for the plane at PVU, met 3 sets of friends

A young man in the neighborhood, who will be married in June.

A co-worker from 10 years ago, Spencer W.

A former Mission President of Korea Seoul Mission (KSM)

Was offered a ticket to the SF Giants game.

We passed it on to our son and we dined nearby

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The room was filled with 4 families and each family had 4 children.

It was chaotic and organized at the same time.

Reminded of the verse in Jacob,

> Behold, their [husbands](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7a) [love](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7b) their [wives](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#note7c), and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children;
>
> Jacob 3:7

Next day, a meal at the home of the parents.

One side of their large living room was covered with family photos.

4 Sons and 1 daughter and their families.

All of the family had 4 children.

From a marriage in the 1980s, there are now 20 grandchildren.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to lunch, the father took me on a tour of their house.

Their original home was nearly doubled.

In the back of their home was an addition, nearly the size of their original house, built by him.

The work area contained equipment and future projects of all types.

Next to his work area was a sewing room for his wife.

To the southeast of their house was a chicken coop of a dozen chickens.

Directly east was a half dozen raised garden beds.

On the day of our visit, they held a belated Easter Egg Hunt.

20 excited grandchildren plus invited guests' children were let loose.

Repair and Restore

1971 VW from Mendin NV was waiting its turn to be worked on.

They know how to work the land and fix things.

They will never run out of things to be worked on.

They, their children, and their children will never say, I am bored.

When they are in the presence of their grandparents, they will talk of work and practice building things.

Their 1/4 acre 1,011.72 square meters or 10,890 square feet.

A family that is building an empire.
