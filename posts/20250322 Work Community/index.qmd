Our company posted 2 positions.

Within days, we received over 100 and 50 applicants respectively.

Asked the hiring manager how he selects future employees, as he stood over, he is well over 6 feet tall, the partition that separated our work areas.

I will first separate AI Assisted or Generated resumes that matches, word for word, accomplishtments and our requirements.

It is difficult to have a 100% match, so I will pass on those with a perfect match.

From the group with less than ideal match, I will look for those that will fit within our company culture.

Lastly I will seek those that have the essential skills we need, or train the rest.

Rebekah's choice

Abraham wanted to choose a wife for Isaac from the kinsmen.

Not from Canaanites, for they had different belief and thus Isaac would serve other gods.

When I was dating, perhaps sensing my picky nature, my mother said this

Choose traits you want in your future wife.

Prioritize those requirements.

Then if you find one that has 80% of traits, marry her.

She also followed my manager's 3 rules,

-   no one is perfect

-   can he/she fit the family culture

-   possess essentials and can train for others

The story of how **Rebekah** was chosen as a wife for **Isaac** by **Abraham's servant** is found in **Genesis 24**. Here’s a summary:

### **Abraham’s Mission for His Servant**

Abraham, now old, wanted his son Isaac to marry someone from his homeland rather than a Canaanite woman. So, he sent his most trusted servant (traditionally thought to be **Eliezer**) to **Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor**, where his relatives lived. He made the servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s own people and not from the local Canaanites.

### **The Servant’s Prayer for Guidance**

When the servant arrived at a well outside the city, he prayed to God for a **sign**. He asked that when he asked a young woman for a drink of water, she would not only give him water but also offer to draw water for his camels. This, he believed, would be a sign that she was the right wife for Isaac.

### **Rebekah’s Kindness and God’s Sign**

Before the servant even finished his prayer, **Rebekah**—the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother, Nahor—came to the well. When the servant asked her for a drink, she **eagerly** gave him water and also offered to **draw water for his camels**, just as he had prayed! Since camels can drink a lot, this act showed her **kindness, generosity, and hardworking nature**.

### **The Servant’s Confirmation and Gifts**

Amazed, the servant asked who she was. When he learned she was from Abraham’s family, he bowed and thanked God for guiding him. He then gave Rebekah **gold jewelry** as gifts.

### **Rebekah’s Family Approves the Marriage**

The servant went to Rebekah’s home and explained his mission to her family. Her brother **Laban** and her father **Bethuel** agreed that this was God’s will and allowed Rebekah to go with the servant to marry Isaac. Rebekah herself agreed, showing her **faith and willingness** to follow this destiny.

### **Rebekah and Isaac’s Marriage**

Rebekah traveled back with the servant to **Canaan**. When Isaac saw her, he took her into his mother **Sarah’s tent** and married her. The Bible says **he loved her**, and she became a comfort to him after his mother’s death.

This story highlights **faith, divine guidance, and the importance of character** in choosing a life partner. Would you like a deeper analysis or a retelling in a different style?
