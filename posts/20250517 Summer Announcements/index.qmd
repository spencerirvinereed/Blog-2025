One of the benefits of living in US and working in the Beehive State is meeting a diverse group of people.

Including people that were born, raised in other cultures and immigrated from countries all over the globe.

Although precise statistics is not available, there are a significant portion of the population that knows of the culture and speak languages other than English (LOTE).

It is estimated that 55 languages are taught at the Missionary Training Center and some 65% of the students of Brigham Young University speak a LOTE.[^1]

Working with fellow immigrants have afforded a chance to learn about people with different background than mine.

Also learn about their history and culture, without actually visiting their country.

Most of all, understanding the common thread of human existence. A quest for freedom, a place to call home, and a chance to improve the living standard.

Using their reserve of gold they got on a boat and endured 2 weeks of travel through Malaysia, Singapore and eventually to a small off the main islands of Indonesia.

Refugees were then interviewed by representatives from countries that took in the `Boat People` According to Wikipedia, significant numbers resettled in the United States, Canada, Italy, Australia, France, West Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Their compass broke after a few days.

They relied on their navigation skills and southern constellation stars

Their source of water was a tarp that collected dews (condensation) and rains

Vietnamese boat people without compasses relied on a combination of traditional navigational techniques, celestial guidance, and observation of natural phenomena to navigate

According my friend, nearly 1 million people perished.

The wikipedia puts the number between 200,000 to 400,000

The total number of people that fled the country is nearly 800,000

They were interviewed by a number of countries, as if applying for a job

They fled, we flew

Encountered pirates as they approached Malaysian coast and were forcefully towed out of Singapore harbor

Our family took a more direct route, Seoul to Alaska to Chicago then Washington DC

Seong came here on their foot pushing and pulling others came to skate scape scape escape machines that took away basic human rights they come to work to associate and to build on their dreams my parents did so dead so first to Alaska they joined us later as many others have this interesting that many people that we need back in East are now here I came here for education after serving 18 months in Los Angeles at that time I didn't know what turned out to be a 40 year commitment or multi decade commitment we have settled and we work looking back it was a tremendous journey journey like to thank the people in Utah accepting accepting or allowing us to prosper

Thomas soul once said that latter-day Saints live on average 10 years or longer dead population the comparison population why is that he said they don't drink drugs and then I go around shooting each othe there was a time when I wish that we were also elsewhere of popular states or some of the East Coast or even Hawaii but now many years later so people are choosing to join us I believe because the majority of the people still adhere to millennia old commandments love God and your little neighbor and start this practice at home

Why am I here

Not a forced upon me, no one asked me to live here. I made that choice
