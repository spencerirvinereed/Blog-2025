When families visit, especially older siblings, it is an internal and a performance audit. 
We learn of their schedule and the scope of their visit, usually in advance.

Thus helping to make sure the house is in order and remove any items that are not necessary for the audit.
We got the notice 3 weeks prior to their arrival.

They were supporting their daughter-in-law who is an ultra runner by taking care of their new born grandson.

(Their counterpart, in-laws live an half an hour away).

Whereas my sister traveled 2000 miles and crossed 2 time zones.

There's saying that refers to summers, that my mom said often.

> 오뉴월(五六月) 볕하루만 쬐도 낫다.[^1]

Which is normally explained as,

> during the **lunar May and June (오뉴월 in 음력)**, even a single day of sunshine can make **plants and animals grow rapidly**.

-   It metaphorically expresses that **even a short period of favorable conditions** can bring about **noticeable growth or improvement**.

-   This can apply to various situations, such as **learning, personal development, or recovery**, where a **small positive influence can have a significant impact**.

But somehow I heard it a little differently and interpreted it as,

> It is better to be born early, even by one day

I thought it was a bit of a stretch to think that a day can make a difference.

Growing up in 주안, near Incheon (인천), we saw older ladies dressed in a tight black outfit.

I had wondered back then, why were these foreigners in our neighborhood?

Later, I learned that the port of Incheon was a gateway for people coming from the ShanDong (山東) province during the 1920s and earlier.[^2]

Then my sister explained, there was a restaurant run by a Chinese family in our neighborhood.
Even though it was small discovery, it helped me understand why I saw foreigners in 주안,

Being born earlier gave her the knowledge and perspective, I didn't have.

A blogger mentions that there is a restaurant run by the 5th generation, 화교.[^3]

It used to be, by talking with my parents, my worries and concerns were diminished or went away altogether.

At times there are questions about life or life as explained by the religion.

It was refreshing to talk to my sister who was closer to my parents and witnessed their hard work and often worked side-by-side with them.

Thereby, she has a better understanding of our parents' views of life and religion.

When I talked about current trends and practices, she brought me back to the beginning or the origin.

That place of the beginning as a refugee then an immigrant family and a practioner of a new found religion, after being a seeker of truth.

For her, there is no need to venture or investigate current topics and practices, she will rely on the faith of our father and mother.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passed the audit with few observations and no findings.

Instead, learned or realized again the importance of remembering our past, specifically life's lessons provided by our parents.

From another witness.

Being audited by someone that knows me from the beginning has its challenges and benefits.

She knows my shortcomings.

At times, she can and should be more direct, pointing our things that I should be doing better and fix those things I need to improve or in violation of.

But as my parents were, she is kinder and gentler.

I did sense, without admonishment, that I needed to learn and be more like my parents, in terms of faith and action being congruent.

In life and at work, we are audited, reviewed, evaluated.

Passing the audit, attending meetings, and participating in a congregation is an indication or measure of our involvement and dedication.

However, it is what we do during those times that we are not watched or in private that will ultimately define who we are.

Like my siblings I need to arrive at the measure and stature of hard working, strong faith yet be a gentle person who overcame the challenges of this life.

> "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."

Ephesians 4:13
