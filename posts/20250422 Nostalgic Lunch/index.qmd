There is a spot along the Lake Bonneville Trail, where one can see the 5 northern Utah County temples.

Saratoga Springs, Timpanogos, Lindon, Orem, and Provo (Rock Canyon)

A bit further to the north, one can see the 2 remaining temples to the south.

Provo City Center and Payson

Before the Richmond Temple, he would have to spend a full day to attend the Washington DC temple some 2\~3 hours away.

Now with the temple about 30 minutes away, he serves on weekends and attends a session during the week.

I reflected on the temple availability and my temple attendance.

I have access to 5 temples within 30 minutes.

Have much less enthusiasm.

I was grateful for his testimony of the temple.

Met a friend for a lunch.

A childhood and a primary friend.

This was the 3rd time we met since days in the 인천 답동 Ward.

The reason for his visit was,

> His grandchild asked why his grandparents never show up for grandparents day.

So they flew in from Richmond, VA to be at the event.

He attended the local Korean Ward that meets in the Orem Sunset Stake Building.

Although he is a year younger, we joined the 답동와드 about the same time.

Learned that his father was from 황해도 area, my mother also lived there, before her escape to South

During lunch he provided an abbreviated history of the church in the area we grew up in

In addition, he updated the early Korean Saints of 인천, as he sketched the family trees of each family.

My friend immigrated some 30 years after our family moved to the United States.

Because of that he had a fresh, more objective views than me.

He said, in general people in America tend to perform services more readily and it is part of their being.

I was taken back and felt that this something I strive to do, but come up short.

As we parted, I learned more from this visit.

Perhaps, on next visit, I will have some progress to report to him.
