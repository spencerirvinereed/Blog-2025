> I see you have a camera like the one I used to have,

> Nowdays cell phone cameras take better photos than those DSLRs.^[Digital Single Lens Reflex]

A gentleman my age commented, as I walked with a camera Nikon introduced in December 2007, around the "Bowl" at a nearby ÂÖ¨Âúí.

Furthermore, as a proof, he showed photos of Grand Canyon in February.

The ones he took with an iPhone.

It was a great set of photos, taken from the South Rim as the shadows from the setting sun highlighted the Canyon.

I had to agree with him, this old DSLR would not take better photos, if the comparison was based on the visual representation.

However, there is one thing, a limitation of the phone based camera.

One cannot take a technically bad photo.

That option is no longer available.

And if one can't take a bad photo how does one learn about

> capturing moments with light

*A **manual transmission**, often called a **stick shift**, is a type of gearbox used in vehicles that requires the driver to manually change gears using a **clutch pedal** and a **gear stick** (or shift lever).*

*Manual transmissions have seen a significant decline in the U.S. automotive market over the past few decades. In 1995, approximately 26.8% of vehicles sold at CarMax featured manual transmissions. In 2018 that figure dropped to 3.7%*

*There has been a resurgence driven by younger drivers seeking a more engaging driving experience and a sense of nostalgia along with enthusiasts that continue to seek them out for the control and driving pleasure they offer*.[^1]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learned to drive a stick shift on streets of El Pueblo de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles de Porci√∫ncula,

Because Koreans were scattered throughout the mission and some outside the county, we were given an car, with an automatic transmission - A Chevrolet Chevette[^2].

[^2]: A front-engine, rear-drive subcompact hatchback available in 3- and 5-door configurations. It was Chevrolet's entry-level model, known for its affordability and simplicity

Initially, my senior companion, with 6 months remaining, drove exclusively around K-Town as well as many locations that required freeway driving.

There was another set of Korean-speaking elders that covered the south half of the mission, that is mainly LA county and some of the Orange county.

They also had a Chevette but their tan version had a manual transmission.

Elder C from Hawaii suggested I learn how to drive it.

No pre-training, we just drove around the streets of Bellflower and Norwalk and hoped I would learn.

In the beginning, stalled out the engine due to improper timing between the clutch pedal and the stick shift.

But after making a few drivers upset along the Rosecrans Avenue, I got the hang of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Didn't have a car during college years.

Going back to college, as a graduate student, my parents bought a car for me.

Opted for a Subaru Station Wagon, a DL model with a 4WD, well suited for Utah.

The car served me well with its ample cargo space, when 2nd row seats were folded down.

However when Sister K married me, she didn't know how to drive a manual transmission.

Gave an effort to teach her but I was not as efficient nor patient as Elder C.

We didn't get very far, Sister K enlisted help of a her friend and she could drive the Subaru while I was at school.

When we bought, with help from our parents, a Mercury Villager, Sister K was elated.

She could take children to school and was free from the clutch and stick routine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much like the Artificial Intelligence aided, enabled understanding and task completion, the essential part of growth and learning has been eliminated.

These days, it is difficult to kill an engine while driving.

Even if one was able to override the algorithm and take a bad shot, it would be difficult to pin-point what contributed to photos being out of focus.

That agency or choice is not available in press-button photo taking and AI generated answers.

In taking or making photos, like in other efforts in life, mistakes will be made.

In those mistakes, lessons are given and learned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gentleman that sold me the Nikon camera said,

> I can no longer distinguish a focused vs un-focused photo, take it and see if you can take good shots.

9 months into owning the camera, there are buttons, settings and mirrors that I haven't used.

Several times, I was tempted to use the automatic mode.

Sadly Nikon doesn't provide that mode, closest mode is the Aperture Mode.

I had to learn, or re-learn, the inter-relationship of the aperture opening, shutter speed and the light sensitivity as measured in ISO.[^3]

[^3]: ISO refers to the sensitivity of your camera's sensor (or film) to light

Photos taken with this camera has a number of flaws.

But it represents the reality better.

That is, it matches what my eyes sees better than the cell phone logic generated photos.

Learned for myself, rather than pursuing skills and equipment to make photos like those of the professionals, make a photo or record of your own experience.

If the goal or the pursuit is to understand how light is captured and processed, then purchase a used DSLR and go take pictures of unique offerings in the neighborhood

## üì∑ **What is a Camera Sensor?**

A **camera sensor** is the **electronic component** inside a digital camera that **captures light** coming through the lens and converts it into an image.

Think of it like the **digital version of film** in old cameras.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç **How It Works:**

1.  **Light enters** through the lens.
2.  It hits the **sensor**, which is covered with millions of tiny light-sensitive units called **photosites** or **pixels**.
3.  Each pixel **measures the amount of light** and color that hits it.
4.  The sensor **sends this data** to your camera‚Äôs processor, which turns it into a digital image.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìê **Key Sensor Terms:**

| **Term**                           | **What It Means**                                                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Megapixels (MP)**                | How many million pixels the sensor has. More MPs = higher potential resolution.           |
| **Full-frame Sensor**              | Same size as 35mm film. Great low-light performance and shallow depth of field.           |
| **Crop Sensor (APS-C, Micro 4/3)** | Smaller than full-frame. Brings distant subjects closer, but can be noisier in low light. |
| **Dynamic Range**                  | How well the sensor captures both dark shadows and bright highlights.                     |
| **ISO Sensitivity**                | How sensitive the sensor is to light (controlled by ISO settings).                        |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß† **Why It Matters:**

-   A **larger sensor** usually gives you **better image quality**, especially in **low light**.
-   It affects **depth of field** (how blurry your background can be).
-   It determines how much **detail and clarity** your camera can capture.
