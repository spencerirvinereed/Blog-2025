Growing up, I watched my share of American Bandstand and Soul Train.

These shows played popular songs and occasionally the artist themselves would perform the number.

The Bandstand host would ask participants, why they liked a certain music or songs.

They all had same response.

> It has a beat one can dance to.

Aging evens out and normalizes songs 2 elements, music and lyrics.

A song that remains a favorite has a supporting lyric.

Although the music is what draws one to the song, it is the lyric that sustains and remains a favorite

*---*

*He said he's goin' back to find*\
*A simpler place and time*\
*And I'll be with him*

At one level, songs convey relationships, breakups and reunions, with attendant heartaches or euphoria.

*L.A. proved too much for the man*\
*So he's leavin' the life he's come to know*

That relationship spoken of, like many others, is between men and women.

*I'd rather live in his world*\
*Than live without him in mine*

In this life we are either going to a destination

Or leaving the place of familiarity for a better place.

However, there are times, a song can portray relationship that are beyond this life.

Is he young man leaving a place or going back to a place.

Generational love

—-

A young man grew restless in his wealthy father’s suburban home. He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.

One day, he demands **his share of the inheritance** early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake **moves to the city**, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—**lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.**

For a while, Jake feels **on top of the world**, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. **A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling.** Desperate, he looks for work but **has no real job experience.**

**He remembers how good life was at home**—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.

Swallowing his pride, Jake **calls his father**, expecting rejection. Instead, his father **rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him** like nothing ever happened. **"Welcome home, son,"** he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, **“You were lost, but now you're found.”**

Jake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. **“I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”**\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biblical reference of, The Prodigal Son, where a son recklessly spends his inheritance but is later forgiven by his father.

This use of *prodigal* refers more to **someone who strays but later returns** rather than just being wasteful.

His father responds, **“You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.

We will also be on that train, albeit at different times and travelling at different speed.

To the same destination.

Someday we will be with him, that model shown by those that preceded us.

That spiritual home in this life.

Where we are first loved and receive all that our parents have.

We in turn, learn how to love, how to give to the next generation.
