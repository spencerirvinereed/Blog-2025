*He said he's goin' back to find*\
*A simpler place and time*\
*And I'll be with him*

At one level, songs convey relationships, breakups and reunions, with attendant heartaches and euphoria.

*L.A. proved too much for the man*\
*So he's leavin' the life he's come to know*

That relationship is normally among men and women.

*I'd rather live in his world*\
*Than live without him in mine*

However, there are times, a song can portray relationship that are beyond this life.

A young man grew restless in his wealthy father’s suburban home. He had everything—comfort, security, and a clear path to taking over the family business. But Jake didn’t want security; he wanted freedom, excitement, and success on his own terms.

One day, he demands **his share of the inheritance** early. His father, heartbroken but unwilling to stop him, transfers a large sum to Jake’s account. With that money, Jake **moves to the city**, rents a high-rise apartment, and starts living the dream—**lavish parties, expensive clothes, fancy restaurants, and a social circle of influencers and club-goers.**

For a while, Jake feels **on top of the world**, but soon, the money starts disappearing faster than he imagined. His new “friends” disappear when the cash dries up. **A market crash wipes out his investments, rent is overdue, and debt collectors start calling.** Desperate, he looks for work but **has no real job experience.**

Broke and ashamed, Jake takes a job at a greasy **fast-food restaurant**, flipping burgers for minimum wage. He sleeps in a run-down hostel and eats whatever food is left at the restaurant at the end of the night. **He remembers how good life was at home**—even his father’s employees lived better than he did now.

Swallowing his pride, Jake **calls his father**, expecting rejection. Instead, his father **rushes to the city, finds him, and embraces him** like nothing ever happened. **"Welcome home, son,"** he says. He throws a party for Jake, buys him a fresh suit, and tells him, **“You were lost, but now you're found.”**

Jake’s older brother, who stayed home and managed the family business, is furious. **“I worked hard while he wasted everything. Why does he get a celebration?”**\

His father responds, **“You have always been with me, and everything I have is yours. But your brother was lost and has come back—that is worth celebrating.”**

Jake has come home on that Midnight Train from LA.
Someday we will be with him, to be in that simpler world.
