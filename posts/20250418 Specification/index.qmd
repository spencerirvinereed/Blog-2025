For a while, I have contemplated Èö±ÈÄÄ(ÏùÄÌá¥) and freedom from responsibility.

Now that time is fast approaching, I am concerned about freedom, specifically unbounded free time.

Specification

Lived and worked in FDA Domain of Design Control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FDA Design Control** refers to a set of **regulatory requirements** defined by the U.S. **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** to ensure that **medical devices** are **safely and effectively designed**. It‚Äôs a key component of **Quality System Regulation (QSR)** found in **21 CFR Part 820.30**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç **What is Design Control?**

Design controls are **structured processes** that manufacturers must follow during the **development of medical devices**. The goal is to ensure devices meet **user needs, intended uses**, and **regulatory standards**, minimizing risks and improving quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß± **Core Elements of Design Control (21 CFR 820.30):**

1.  

2.  

    ### **Design and Development Planning**

    -   

    -   Define responsibilities, timelines, and milestones.

    -   

    -   Maintain a **Design and Development Plan** and update as needed.

    -   

3.  

4.  

    ### **Design Input**

    -   

    -   Translate **user needs and intended use** into **measurable design requirements**.

    -   

    -   Must be **reviewed and approved**.

    -   

5.  

6.  

    ### **Design Output**

    -   

    -   Document the **final design specifications** (drawings, production specs, etc.).

    -   

    -   Must be traceable to **design inputs**.

    -   

7.  

8.  

    ### **Design Review**

    -   

    -   Formal, documented **reviews** at various development stages.

    -   

    -   Involve **cross-functional teams** to evaluate progress and identify issues.

    -   

9.  

10. 

    ### **Design Verification**

    -   

    -   Confirm that the design outputs **meet the inputs** (e.g., functional testing).

    -   

    -   ‚ÄúDid we build the product right?‚Äù

    -   

11. 

12. 

    ### **Design Validation**

    -   

    -   Ensure the device **meets user needs and intended uses** under real or simulated conditions.

    -   

    -   ‚ÄúDid we build the right product?‚Äù

    -   

13. 

14. 

    ### **Design Transfer**

    -   

    -   Transition design into **manufacturing specifications** for consistent production.

    -   

15. 

16. 

    ### **Design Changes**

    -   

    -   All design changes must be **reviewed, validated/verified**, and documented.

    -   

17. 

18. 

    ### **Design History File (DHF)**

    -   

    -   A complete record showing **how the design was developed**, reviewed, and validated.

    -   

19. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚úÖ **Why Design Control Matters:**

-   

-   Required for most **Class II and Class III** devices (some **Class I** are exempt).

-   

-   Critical for **FDA inspections**, audits, and **product approvals**.

-   

-   Supports **traceability**, risk management, and product **recall prevention**.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üß† In Practice:

A good design control process typically integrates:

-   

-   **Risk management (ISO 14971)**

-   

-   **Usability engineering (IEC 62366)**

-   

-   **Software validation (if applicable)**

-   

-   And often overlaps with **Design History Record (DHR)** and **Device Master Record (DMR)** management.
