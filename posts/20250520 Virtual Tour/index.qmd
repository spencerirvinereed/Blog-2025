Recently, visited Korea and Japan - vicariously.

My sister and her husband to travelled to Japan and Korea earlier this month.

The trip in Korea included visits with the surviving siblings of my mother and my father.

Likewise, my brother-in-law went to the hometown of his mother in Japan.

It was my sister's first visit in nearly 15 years and twice that for my 매형.

Felt the impact of visit.

Saw the places they visited, the food they sampled.

Wondered how they would be like if I visited in person

When they shared photos taken with loved ones, felt as if I were there with them as well.

Wondered if this is how our parents felt, when they were raising us.

When we let them be a part of our lives, they would feel included.

Heavenly parents would feel the same way.

They would answer and help in ways we don't fully comprehend.
