Don't recall my parents worrying about the future.

They lived in the present.

Falling back to their past for support and clarity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both experienced hardship, not imaginable to modern day audience

Before they were married.

The war

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the hardship, they were living the life as a God given gift.

They should not be one of the living.

They lived like a physical and spiritual refugees

Developed their own perspective and cadence.

Neither oriental or occidental

The pace was definitely Largo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For my father, everything after his war engagement, was a bonus.

He should have been killed.
