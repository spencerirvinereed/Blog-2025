Growing up, many things were repeated, so it became predictable.

Near Easter or Passover, one of the major networks (there were 3 at the time) would broadcast an epic movie.

Its genre was described as an Epic Drama / Biblical, with a total running time of over 3.5 hours.

That movie was the Ten Commandments (ÂçÅË™°) made in 1956. 
Directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Ramses II.

The AI lists the movie highlights as

-   Parting of the Red Sea scene,
-   grand sets, and
-   dramatic scale

And its themes as,

-   Freedom vs. tyranny
-   Faith and divine law
-   Identity and transformation
-   God‚Äôs power vs. human arrogance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memorable scenes and themes from the movie for me were the

-   Abandonment to the desert and the rescue, rehabilitation, and finding a second life among the Midianites, in particular in Jethro's household.
-   Various plauges and Moses and Aaron confronting the Pharaoh each time, declaring, \`Let My People Go"
-   The `Exodus` of the people of Israel from bondage, led by their spiritual leader, Moses, to serve god and receive the commandments

## The Prince of Egypt (1998)

Didn't think any new adaptation could add to the Ten Commandments narrative and impact a new generation. 

However, when Dreamworks Animation released their interpretation, An Animated Musical / Biblical Epic, the result was enlightening.

Cecil B. DeMille expanded and perfected the somewhat new medium of a large format, color movies, with large sets, costumes, and character development.

The Prince of Egypt infused the storytelling via animation with a large scale scenes and character development. But this version added something else, a modern adaptation of the songs and prayers of the Hebrew slaves.

> ...With the sting of the whip on my shoulder\
> With the salt of my sweat on my brow\
> Elohim, God on high, can you hear your people cry?\

> Help us now\
> This dark hour\
> Deliver us\

> Hear our call, deliver us\
> Lord of all, remember us\
> Here in this burning sand\
> Deliver us\

> There's a land You promised us\
> Deliver us to the Promised Land

-   The Opening Song, Deliver Us

Then Jethro (Brian Stokes Mitchell) delivered this song,

> So how can you see what your life is worth\
> Or where your value lies?\
> You can never see through the eyes of man\
> You must look at your life\
> Look at your life through heaven's eyes

-   If the Ten Commandments were retold today, what would it be like?
-   Would it rival or exceed CGIs of the Marvel Universe or the Star Wars series?
-   What is the relevance of a 3000 year old story?

Perhaps the King's Chronicles offers a clue,

> 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:\ 
12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\ 
13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Today's 10 Commandments and Me

In life and its manifestations or interpretations, some seek for the dramatic, `a great and strong` wind, earthquakes or the fire.

But life's essence is in the small, still things.

As when Moses mother pleaded,

> Hush now my baby, be still, love, don't cry Sleep as you're rocked by the stream Sleep and remember my last lullaby So I'll be with you when you dream

It is repeated each time a new baby is welcomed into the world. And the mother is delivered and makes a plead to God -- as did Moses' mother.

Previous plagues and deliverance from it, those miracles was to transform the people of Israel.
And Moses was transformed as he delivered the commandments to the people. 
Through those public manifestations but more so through many private moments with God, Moses was changed.

As was my mother and my father.

They embodied principles captured in the song,
`When You Believe`,

> ...My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say

My father carried the painful reminder of an industrial accident that he suffered in his early 20s.
My mother's father passed away when she was 14 years of age.  She had to take on the role of the head of the household.

Koreans have had similar experiences and history as other nations.
However, we don't have the rich heritage of stories as the people of Israel.
In case of my family, we lack both written and oral history.

But through my parents' lives, particularly their challenges in this life, they were able to show us how to survive and thrive.

The greatest understanding about life, I learned from them is this,
They were steadfast.

They were consistent, both in public as well as in private.
In times of prosperity and time of famine.

They demonstrated this phrase by Dag Hammarskj√∂ld 

> "It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual\ 
than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses,"

That I may do the same, seek God and find myself and fulfill wishes of my parents.

This my longing on this day.

# AI explains variations in dates of Easter and Passover

The dates of **Easter** and **Passover** vary each year because both are tied to **lunisolar calendars**, but they follow different systems. Here's a breakdown of how each is determined:


## ‚úùÔ∏è **Easter Date Determination**

Easter is celebrated on:

> **The first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox**\
> (fixed as March 21 in church calculations)

### Step-by-step:

1.  Identify **March 21** (ecclesiastical spring equinox).
2.  Find the **first full moon** (called the *Paschal Full Moon*) after March 21.
3.  Easter is the **following Sunday**.

-   This is based on the **Gregorian calendar** (used in Western Christianity).

**Eastern Orthodox** Easter uses the **Julian calendar**, which often results in a different date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ú°Ô∏è **Passover Date Determination**

Passover begins on:

> **The 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan**, which is based on the **Jewish lunisolar calendar**.

### Details:

1.  Nisan begins with the **new moon** closest to the **spring equinox**.
2.  Passover always begins at **sundown** on **15 Nisan**.
3.  It often falls **on or near the full moon**, just like Easter, but is based on the **Hebrew calendar**, not the Gregorian one.

### Duration:

-   **7 days** in Israel
-   **8 days** in the diaspora (for traditional Jews)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìÖ Relationship Between the Two

Easter often falls **during or shortly after Passover**, because the crucifixion of Jesus is described as occurring during Passover.

However, due to different calendar systems and adjustments (e.g., leap months in the Jewish calendar), the two **don‚Äôt always align**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üîÅ Patterns and Exceptions

The **Jewish calendar** occasionally adds a **leap month (Adar II)** to stay in sync with the solar year. This can shift Passover **later**, causing Easter to occur **before** Passover in rare years.

The **Council of Nicaea (325 AD)** fixed the method for calculating Easter, decoupling it from the Jewish calendar, which is why the dates are similar but not identical.
