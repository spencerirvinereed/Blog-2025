> As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on--in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.

-   Morrie Schwartz

> I decided I had to make my own culture. A culture of human relationships, of love, of acceptance, of open communication.

Morrie's mother died when he was 8 years old.

He was extremely close to her and deeply grieved her loss

His father was cold, distant, and unaffectionate.

Morrie vowed to change that culture within his family.

Some continue the wrong tradition or take no part in creating a new tradition.

Whether it is family or society imposed, those traditions that are detrimental to health of a family should be shunned and replaced.

Many have succumbed to gateway substances and habits; tobacco, alcohol and gambling, in prior generations.

My father decided early not to use those addicting and family destroying substances.

Grateful to him for establishing a foundation, both temporarily and spiritually, that allowed us to thrive.

## On Parenting

> If you want the experience of having complete responsibility for another human being, and to learn how to love and bond in the deepest way, then you should have children.

Thank you Morrie for sharing your life with us.

And Mitch Albom for capturing it in a book form.

Thank you Mom and Dad for starting a family.

Braving through life's challenges and showed us what fortitude is.

In life, among men and with God.
