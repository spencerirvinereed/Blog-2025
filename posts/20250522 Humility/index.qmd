> "Humility is just as much the opposite of self-abasement as it is of self-exaltation.\
> To be humble is not to make comparisons, secure in its reality, the self is neither better nor worse, bigger nor smaller, than anything else in the universe.\
> \
> It is nothing, yet at the same time one with everything.
>
> It is in this sense that humility is absolute self-effacement."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growing up my parents restrained from making comparison Within our home or without.

Since there were no comparison with other families, I didn't realize how poor we were. Actually felt secure and hopeful growing up. Thanks to my parents to planting and providing that foundation.

The foundation rooted in Christian principles and infused with generational wisdom of Korea and beyond.

Often feeling close to or near nothing of note. However, if we were asked, we would answer in the affirmative and accomplish the task. With inspriation and help from above and beyond.

## Vägmärken (Markings, or more literally Waymarks)

Published in 1963, it is the only book by former UN secretary general, Dag Hammarskjöld[^3].

The book introduction in Amazon.com states.

This book tells almost nothing of his daily work, or of his thoughts about world events. Instead, it focuses on his struggle and changing relationship with God.

Markings is distinctive, as W.H. Auden remarks in his foreword, as a record of "the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the via activa and the via contemplativa." It reflects its author's efforts to live his creed, his belief that all men are equally the children of God and that faith and love require of him a life of selfless service to others. For Hammarskjöld, "the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action." Markings is not only a fascinating glimpse of the mind of a great man, but also a moving spiritual classic that has left its mark on generations of readers.

> To be nothing in the self-effacement of humility, yet, for the sake of the task, to embody its whole weight and importance in your earing, as the one who has been called to undertake it. To give to people, works, poetry, art, what the self can contribute, and to take, simply and freely, what belongs to it by reason of its identity. Praise and blame, the winds of success and adversity, blow over such a life without leaving a trace or upsetting its balance.
