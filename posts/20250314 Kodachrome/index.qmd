Back in January, called my friend in Pearland, outside of Houston.

He described a scene that doesn't happen very often.

Up to 6 inches of snow had fallen. Everything was closed and he sent a video of an empty street.

He said everything looked different with a fresh coat of white.

Those at a higher elevation and higher latitude see snow more often. The regularity and frequency diminishes the role and beauty of a winter storm.

Not only visually calming, but the sound is also muffled by the stacks or a blanket of snow. The combination of less traffic and silence is otherwordly, for a brief moment.

According to Genesis (Chapters 1,2), God created light, separating it from the darkness. He called the light `day` and the darkness `night`.

-   How long did it take to create the light from matters?
-   How much energy was gathered to create the local sun?
-   Did colors exist from the beginning?

This morning, as I drove home from a brief hike, caught the tail end of a song.

> Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah I got a Nikon camera I love to take a photograph So mama don't take my Kodachrome away

> And everything looks worse (better) in black and white
