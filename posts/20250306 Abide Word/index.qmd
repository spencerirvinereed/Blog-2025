I have enjoyed wonderful works of many artists.

Particularly in the area of music, photography and writing.

At times, I spend much time admiring their talent and effort.

Though I am elevated by their work, I began to feel that something was missing.

They have fulfilled this mandate

> “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”

Matthew 5:16 KJV

In the immensity of YouTube and other media platform, we are made to feel less than a speck.

For the sake of one person, me.

By writing, clear my mind.

"If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"

John 8:31,32
