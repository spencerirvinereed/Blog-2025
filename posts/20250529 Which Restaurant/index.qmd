A quandary inducing question

Where are you from

Which is your favorite Korean restaurant

Is it authentic?

The question most difficult to answer is a Korean American next to the one that says where are you from is this what is your favorite Korean restaurant the honest answer is I don't have one or my house however to keep the conversation going I sometimes answer all the one in Los Angeles about 600 miles away or maybe one in Las Vegas or ones in Korea at times I say each one of the local Korean restaurants have its distinguishing dishes but in reality Korean food is one of those that or not suited for mass production and difficult to make it on demand I was very surprised when I travel to China during the summer of 1997 the ti landed at old on Charles airport and state in typing young Sheraton hotel from there we drove over to bamboo grove hotel in sugar and I was shocked the food that the hotel staff created it wasn't anything like I tasted in US I didn't taste sauce I actually tasted the food

And it was freshly cooked

The fruit the Chinese food I tasted in America was not representative of what the Chinese food people eat and subsequently unlearn each region has his own unique offerings taste flavor fact food in Suzhou and its counterpart in Shanghai only separated by 100 miles no hundred kilometers taste different as they are in Hangzhou

During my last visit to Southern California my old apartment mate doing missionary days met me in early morning temps Alma Seo 5 miles from the airport according to him this place got busy so we moved up the time 10:30 AM not usually a big eater that early in the morning but I ate well I didn't have to water heat you want to wate I was grateful for free and brought back

There's a restaurant located in the area this was freaking frequented by Mýa visiting when you exactly which restaurant we would go to the dishes he would order the dish was calling you send me and he will order the bread that shit by the flower made from flower and if the kids came along he would order one of the street flavor dishes that was our favorite because he joins so muc much different than what is offered now Chinese dish I believe those dishes that we ate is a modification traditional offerings created by the owners passed on down to generations

Korean food like most ethnic food needs to be made with love carefully planned at times preserved coordinated and served with pride and humility the pride of continuing the tradition set forth experimented curated by individuals that long pastor away love considering the welfare the health of individuals that would the offering in the joy of bringing together and the world of food ple please please PLAYS

Aside from the difficulty of gathering offerings are materials ingredients food some food does not lend a self to early preparation preservation enhancement by sauce it Hass to be created by the piety individu

For that certain cultures value the meal at whole fami curlier times in America it was customary not to visit all Collin families during their meal time in the absence of these mail times we are now a wholesale eating out culture

So in order to make food more convenient cuts and trade-offs need to be made song are others not afraid when you combine to many of these trade-offs the football on the represents country version to say this

So if I will give it a genie Genie take me back to a city a town near west of the river in the Panjang region of North Korea and drop me off size kitchen providing a feast to request fly me back to Kyoung young area put me in a home and invite guests oh never mind I forgot FaceTime Aladdin you can I guess that I had in mind so I will continue to go along carry on with given I suppose the other options to learn techniques and skills it bring about the food that I grew up with
