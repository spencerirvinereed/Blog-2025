At a chapel near the new Orem, Utah Temple, there is a bit of anticipation or excitement before a speaker begins.

Whether it will be in ÈüìË™û(ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥) or the language spoken by over a billion people.

If the talk is in Ëã±Ë™û, no translation is offered.

Since it is the acquired or the native language the congregation.

If the speaker talks in Korean, a simultaneous translation is given using a wireless microphone/transmitter and received using headphone attached to a wireless receiver.

It wasn't always this way.

A generation ago, if the speaker chose English, a translator would stand next to the speaker.
Then carefully and faithfully listen to the sentence and provide an interpretation.

That generation, who had learned the English but never fully integrated into society, is no longer.

According to an internet based data, there are one million Korean speakers in the United States.

My son said that people's knowledge of Korea changed.
