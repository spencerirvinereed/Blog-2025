Mom and her sister entered a singing contest.

The song they chose was 오빠 생각 or **Thinking of an Elder Brother**

**듬뿍 듬뿍 듬뿍새 논에서 울고**

**뻐꾹 뻐꾹 뻐꾹새 숲에서 울제**

**우리 오빠 말타고 서울 가시면**

**비단 구두 사가지고 오신다더니**

Mom and aunt practiced hard for the contest.

However, during the part where the singer mimics the voice of a bird, my aunt started laughing.

They managed to recover but since the song has a somber tone, they didn't make if far that evening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lyrics were published 100 years ago in magazine, 어린이.

It was written by a 12 year old, 최순애(1914\~1998) thinking of her older brother 최영주.[^1]

Ms.최 was born around the time my maternal grandmother was born.

박태준 wrote music for the poem in 1930.

By the time my mother and her sister sang the song, in the 1940s, the song would have been a relatively a new song.

Growing up, I would listen to mom's story about the song contest and tried to follow along and learn the words.

Didn't think much of the meaning.

Now that I am older and have experienced some of life's buffeting, I have a deeper appreciation for the song.

The song speaks of waiting, a desire and a hope – at one level.

Knowing that it may never materialize.

My mom knew, she would likely never meet her younger sister.

Separated during her early teenage years.

Not in this life, but she kept her hope.

Her father who passed away at age 35, leaving 6 children with his young wife.

He would never go on another business trip to 인천, and bring home a new dress for his wife.

He didn't return in this life, but his heritage leaves on through his daughters and grandchildren.

Longing for her childhood home, the general store, and the orchard. That were confiscated by the communists, shortly after her father's passing.

Not being allowed to visit or correspond with loved ones for over 70 years.

But we carry that desire to return to our 본관(本貫), family origins.

My parents bore and overcame crushing disappoints in their lifetime.

Yet they found purpose and meaning in their lives through their inborn grit and faith and hope in Christ Jesus.

They waited for their Elder Brother to come and right the wrong.

However, they left this life without realizing their hopes of liberation of a people and experiencing a reconciliation with their loved ones again.

I hope to emulate some of that grit. Realizing that challenges, disappointments, and defeats are a part of this life.

But finding meaning and purpose that eminates from a simple song.

Thereby elevating thoughts and actions towards our Deliverer and the Day of Judgement.

Whether collectively, the 2nd Coming, or individually, as our parents have shown.

**기럭 기럭 기럭이 북\~에서 오고**

**귀뚤 귀뚤 귀뚜라미 슬피울건만**

**서울 가신 오빠는 소식도\~ 없고**

**나뭇잎만 우수수 떨\~어\~집니다.**

> "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable." 1 Corinthians 15:19

## English Translation

English Translation Chirp, chirp, chirp — the rice field birds are crying,

Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo — the forest birds are calling.

When my brother rode off to Seoul on horseback,

He promised he'd bring me silk shoes when he returned…

Honking, honking — the wild geese come from the north,

Crick, crick — the cricket sings its sorrowful song.

But my brother who went to Seoul sends no word,

And only the leaves fall, fluttering to the ground.
