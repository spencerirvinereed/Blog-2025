Our neighborhood is within walking distance to one of the largest private universities.

One can take a leisurely walk, all down hill, and be on campus within 30 minutes.

Consequently, we have a great deal of neighbors that teach at that school.

Mathematics, English, Counseling Psychology, Engineering, Family History, Public Health, and Economics.

When one of them teaches on Sunday, an interesting dynamics is realized.

The class members, ranging from newlyweds to retirees are transformed into students.

The competition for answers is fierce.

The level and the depth is both intense and insightful.

On some days, one wonders if this is a neighborhood, 2nd hour class or a graduate class, with a pre-requisite, taught by one of the neighbors that are also professors.

The first writing assignment of the semester.

> Write about a time that you gave something of value away, other than time.

Responses from the class,

-   What do I value?

-   We don't know its value until it is gone.

-   Does my action align with my value?

The professor brought the discussion back to topic.

> What is a worth of a soul?

Although difficult, suspend judgments, and train ourselves to see others as God sees us.

---

Another professor/teacher asked a simpler question.

> Why church?

Diverse answers came fast,

-   for congregational learning

-   preventing drifting

-   joint goals

-   opportunities to serve

-   provide an organization

Then came this,

Justification vs. Sanctification and

Righteousness vs Holiness

I am uplifted by attending a neighborhood gathering on Sundays.

It is part of established spiritual home, a legacy of my parents.

I have witnessed my parents' lives.

They lived a simple, god fearing (revering) and a life of serving fellowmen.

At times the gospel seems to be complex with some incomprehensible teachings.

I feel like the person mentioned in the 9th Chapter of John.

[**25**](https://biblehub.com/john/9-25.htm) He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner *or no*, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

I don't know whether I have given away something of value or all of the reasons for attending churches and congregations.

But I do know one thing, by accepting Christ and following His teachings, I was blind but I am beginning to see things as they are.
