Hi grandpa, actually read your writing from the early 2025.\
The one about learning English as an immigrant.

**Older Me**

Thank you, hope it made sense to you.\
I wrote in those days to hold on to memories.\
Began to forget details of events and flows in life.

**손자/孫子**

Is that the main reason you continued to write?\
To overcome memory loss.\
Any other reasons?

**Older Me**

Writing has many benefits.\
But I didn't think much about writing, it was for someone else.\
Growing up, we weren't encouraged to talk about or draw attention to ourselves.\
Thus we didn't adjust to the wave of social media too well.\
We were busy living the life of an immigrant.

**손자/孫子**

Then how did you overcome and actually begin?

**Older Me**

Mission and Church Callings\
The beginning of writing was the weekly letter home.\
It was written in Korean.\
It got better towards the end of the mission, it was really basic.\
But it was consistent.

Then nearly 40 years later I was working with young people.\
I thought of ways to contact them and make a meaningful interactions -- apart from the Sabbath interactions.

We had a group page on a popular platform.\
I wrote about things I knew and experienced.\
Topics were normal everyday things but I kept it up for a several years.

**손자/孫子**

So you mainly wrote to family members and to members of a congregation you worked with.\
That seems like a limited audience, was it worth the effort?

**Older Me**

Most definitely.

Although I didn't actively engage in an one-on-one conversations, some people commented that they appreciated my writings.

But like most earthly efforts, it the end the beneficiary is the one that made most effort.

As I wrote, my thinking and language comprehension became clearer and improved.\ 
In addition, I realized once again the sacrifice and blessings of parents and family.

And something I didn't expect.

I began to see that my life had been a meaningful.\
Filled with seemingly small events and memories.\
People that guided and lifted me.

It was a cycle of as one writes, more comprehension, more gratitude.

And as a bonus a renewal of a spirit.

**손자/孫子**

That is a good summary. \
But now days, Artificial Intelligence is ever present.\ 
We really don't think about writing anymore.

Besides, aren't all of the important topics have been written about and the subject is exhausted.

**Older Me**

One can think like the writer of Ecclesiates,

> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun

However, truly new and meaningful event is the one that you participate and gain a personal experience.

That will continue throughout this life and beyond into another realm.

**손자/孫子**

That is a good motivation.

Where should I begin, I don't know much without the AI support.

**Older Me**

Exodus 20:12

> Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you (NIV)

Begin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.

If fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life.
