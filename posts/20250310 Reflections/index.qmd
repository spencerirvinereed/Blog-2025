**손자/孫子**

Hi grandpa, read your writing from the early 2025.\
The one about learning English as an immigrant.

**Older Me**

Thank you, hope it made sense to you.\
I wrote in those days to hold on to memories.\
Began to forget details of events and flows in life.

**손자/孫子**

Is that the main reason you continued to write?\
To compensate for memory loss.\
Any other reasons?

**Older Me**

For a long time, I didn't think much about writing, it was for someone else.\
Growing up, we weren't encouraged to talk about or draw attention to ourselves.\
Thus we didn't adjust to the new wave of social media too well.\
We were busy living the life of an immigrant.

**손자/孫子**

Then how did you overcome and actually begin?

**Older Me**

Mission and Church Callings\
The beginning of writing was the weekly letter home.\
It was written in Korean.\
It got better towards the end of the mission, it was really basic.\
But it was consistent.

Decades later I was working with young people.\
I thought of ways to contact them -- apart from the Sabbath interactions.

We had a group page on a popular platform.\
I wrote about things I knew and experienced.\
Topics were common, everyday things but I kept it up for a several years.

**손자/孫子**

So you mainly wrote to family members and to members of a congregation you worked with.\
That seems like a limited audience, was it worth the effort?

**Older Me**

Most definitely.

Like most earthly efforts, in the end the beneficiary is the one that made most effort.

As I wrote, my thinking and language comprehension became clearer and improved.  In addition, I realized once again the sacrifice and blessings of parents and family.

And something I didn't expect.

I began to see that my life had been a meaningful one.\
Filled with seemingly small events and memories.\
People that guided and lifted me.

It was a cycle of as one writes, more comprehension, more gratitude.

And as a bonus a renewal of a spirit.

**손자/孫子**

That is a good summary.\
But now days, Artificial Intelligence is ever present.  
We really don't think about writing anymore.

Besides, aren't all of the important topics have been written about and the subject is exhausted.

**Older Me**

One can think like the writer of Ecclesiates,

> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun

However, truly new and meaningful event is the one that you participate in and gain a personal experience.

That will continue throughout this life and beyond into another realm.

A word of caution.

Balance writing with carrying out your convictions.
The time spent in writing can be used to improve lives of others, which in turn improves your life.

Can you think of instances where followers wrote down teachings of the master?

**손자/孫子**

Let's see. (using AI Prompts)  

- Christ and his followers or disciples.
- Confusius and Analects written by his students
- Socrates as captured through Plato and Xenophon
- Buddha and his monks and disciples
- Lao Tzu and Tao Te Ching compiled by disciples.

Quite a lot.

**Older Me**

Likewise, my parents didn't write much.
They were busy making a living and doing good to others.

So it is fitting that those of us that benefited most write a little.

**손자/孫子**

That is a good motivation.

Where should I begin, I don't know much without the AI support.

**Older Me**

Exodus 20:12

> Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you (NIV)

Begin by recalling, capturing, thereby honoring their life and legacy.

If fear or reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom then honoring parents ought to be the beginning of a long and a prosperous life.

Here are several examples where the originator of significant ideas or teachings did not write them down directly, but their disciples or followers preserved and transmitted their teachings:

1. **Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE)**  
   - **Writings by:** Plato, Xenophon  
   - Socrates never wrote down his own philosophy. His ideas survive through the works of Plato (e.g., *The Republic*, *Apology*) and Xenophon.

2. **Confucius (551–479 BCE)**  
   - **Writings by:** His disciples  
   - The *Analects* is a collection of Confucius' sayings and ideas compiled by his followers after his death.

3. **Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama) (c. 563–483 BCE)**  
   - **Writings by:** Buddhist monks and disciples  
   - Buddha's teachings were passed down orally for centuries before being written down in texts like the *Tripitaka*.

4. **Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BCE–30 CE)**
