There aren't many surnames in Korea.

According to Open-AI, GPT, there are approximately 280 family names.

However, top 3 names, Kim, Lee, and Park account for nearly half of the population (\~45%).

GPT further explains,

> Many surnames are distinguished by their **bon-gwan** (본관, 本貫), which indicates the ancestral hometown or clan origin. This creates distinct family lineages even among those with the same surname

So the actual distinguishable family names could reach thousands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our family name is associated with 진주 강씨(晉州 姜氏), one of largest Kang clans within 1.2 million people that are named Kangs.

I have not seen my father's family record or 계보([系譜](https://www.wikiwand.com/ko/dictionary/%E7%B3%BB%E8%AD%9C "系譜")).

I don't know whether there was a copy of the genealogical record in North Korea.

I do know that North Korean refugees could re-establish family records in South Korea after the war.

Many families registered family relationships, adding birth and marriage dates from recollections of surviving elders.

Also I recall that my grandfather's mother remarried. She thought about changing grandfather's name from Kang to Shin. Grandfather refused and kept the surname of Kang.

Based on that story, we are part of the Kang family. At least when my grandfather Kang became of age. Whether belonging to 진주 강씨 clan, is based on a record is not verifiable.

It is estimated that over a million people fled North Korea and settled in South Korea.

Both of my parent's family added to those figures. All of my father's siblings married a fellow North Koreans As did my mother's sisters.

I still recall, how they would switch to their local dialects during family gatherings.

That distinctive sound is no longer common.

But every now and then, I hear a voice that reminds me of my father's home. People like, Mr. Ogden 박 and Mr. Sandy 김. I believe both of them were born and raised in towns near my father's hometown of 안변.

```

My father's hometown is about 5 miles southeast of the city of 원산. And about 100kim north of the DMZ on the East Coast of Korea.

If a way opens up, I would travel to .

한남도 안변군 신모면 이남리 47

When I arrive there, I would pay a visit to my grandfather(강현용) and father's older brother's (강금섭) graves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My mother told me about her 태몽(胎夢 / conception dream)

She was in a mountainous area, a canyon. Met an elderly gentleman, dressed in white, with a beard.

Although she never met him, she recognized him as my grandfather. He handed her a book, she had an impression that it was the Kang Family History.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years, I believed for and hoped that a way would be open for us to access the genealogical records in Korea.

Now that hope is fading.

Meanwhile, I will follow this teaching

> 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.  Luke 3:8 (KJV)

Also, I will do my best to record things that I remember. 
Things my parents told me about their recollections.

I hope to be aided in this effort by the Spirit.
