A new gathering place for Asians and those familiar with Asian cuisine opened in 2014[^1]

[^1]: Salt Lake Chinatown officially opened in **2014**. It's a community hub featuring a variety of Asian restaurants, shops, and hosts cultural events. The complex is also home to an Asian supermarket that has expanded to include representation from various Asian countries.

From a few options in the beginnings, it has grown to offer a wide variety offerings.

New additions to the south was nearing end, as of May, 2025.

Stopped by a stall, across from a well known bakery, that was selling 雞爪.[^2]

[^2]: Chicken Feet

Started a conversation with the owner.

I asked a few questions in my very limited 普通话.

Asked about the dishes and where he was from.

> 什麼地方人

Surprisingly he understood me.

He is from 長春.

I asked him about nearby areas 哈爾濱 and 延边州.

Recalling those cities from reading about Koreans in Manchuria.

I was happy that he carried the conversation and encouraged me to speak in Mandarin.

Told him of the areas I have visited.[^3]

[^3]: Shanghai,Suzhou,Hangzhou,Hong Kong,Dong Guan,Guang Zhou,Beijing

And experiencing the variety of offering, cultural and cuisine of each region.

A country, a union of multi-cultural states or provinces.

It brought back memories of feeling the energy of its citizens and eager businessmen ready to make deals.

## Conversations in a Marriage

When I was married, my Korean was at a level similar to a 귀환선교사.[^4].

[^4]: 帰還宣教師, a returned missionary

I was more comfortable speaking in English. But Sister K spoke only in Korean.

Although I grew up in a Korean home, my language skills were limited to a vocabulary of a teenager speaking to parents

One of us had to learn quickly.

However, what I needed was more than just verbal language improvement.\
I needed a whole suit of training on human relationship in a marriage.

-   Empathy and Understanding
-   Conflict Resolution
-   Appreciation and Affection
-   Trust & Honesty
-   Effective Communication

After 30+ years of a life lived together, I am beginning to be a better communicator, not necessarily because I am a better speaker of Korean or English.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking it over, `The Man from 長春` anticipated my questions and formulated his answer rather than actually hearing and understanding my pronunciations.

Wonder how often my parents and Sister K read the thoughts and intents of my mind and heart without exchanging words.

I marvel how parents know the needs of a young or newborns without them uttering words or poorly formed words that others can't understand.

Furthermore, used to think that there will be a unifying language in next life.

A Celestial Esperanto.[^5]

[^5]: Esperanto is a constructed international auxiliary language created in 1887 by L.L. Zamenhof with the goal of facilitating communication between people from different linguistic backgrounds. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple and regular grammar, and vocabulary largely borrowed from European languages. While not an official language of any country, Esperanto is spoken by an estimated 2 million people worldwide.

That will finally put to rest, which of the many languages is closest to the one before the Tower of Babel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the interaction with 長春的男子 and watching parents communicate with young ones, and my own married life, I am inclined to believe that there is a higher level of conversation.

The one without grammar or vocabulary. The one that is location independent or dialect-free.

That method of communication will be action based. With occasional confirmation, using our countenance, both as means of transmitting and receiving messages.

As we approach Zion Society, there will be less need for the current method of expressing ideas or giving commands via spoken words.

The bias will be towards action. There will be far less misunderstanding, since the result will be visible to all.

> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

-   KJV Matthew 15:11
