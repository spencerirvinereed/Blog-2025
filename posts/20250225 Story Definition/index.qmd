At some gatherings, it seems the apex has been reached.

The music, the talk, the remembrance of the suffering all come together, all confirmed by the spirit..

A bit of old self is left behind or let go.

A new resolutions are made and some kept.

A gentleman rolled up to the front on a mobility knee scooter. carefully, he made his way to the podium and related his experience in the French Polynesia -- as a young man, 44 years ago.

He recalled teaching a family with a daughter that was 8 years old at the time. He bore his witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. He then said, that person was in attendance at church today.

As the last speakers, two ladies came to the front. They both stood together. The older person, read 2 sentences from her phone, in English.

Then she switched to her native tongue and her daughter translated.

They quoted this verse

> Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?

-   Jacob 3:7

And how they resolve differences in their home.

Their mom made children say these 3 things.

-   I am sorry
-   I apologize
-   I love you Then they were to kiss and hug one another.

A simple and effective way to build an eternal family.

Seeing the impact of a missionary effort and to hear a sweet testimony of a mother and her daughter stirred my soul.

To start the 2nd hour of instruction and edification, the teacher related this.

At the beginning of a semester, she assigns the following.

> Account of giving away something of a value, other than money.

This started a discussion on what things are of value or worth.

A gentleman said,

> Until it is gone, we don't know its value.

She then related of a story, attributed to Socrates,

### **Socrates and the Small House**

One day, a wealthy man came to visit **Socrates** and was surprised to see the great philosopher living in a **tiny, modest house**. Looking around at the bare walls and simple furniture, the man scoffed and said,

*"How can someone as wise as you live in such a small and empty place?"*

Socrates smiled and replied,\
*"If only you could see how much room there is for my friends."*

The man was puzzled, so Socrates continued,\
*"A house is not measured by its size or the wealth inside it, but by the warmth of the friendships it holds."*

At that moment, a group of Socrates' friends arrived, filling the small space with laughter and conversation. The wealthy man realized that **true richness comes not from material things, but from the people around us**.

She summarized, the house is big enough to hold his true friends

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next topic was,

Does my action align with my values?

What can I do actively, so that my actions match my values.

-   Think celestially

-   We can't live unto ourselves

-   Get proximate to people who are suffering

-   Practice holy envy

We learned about Joseph Millett

### **The Story of Joseph Millett**

Joseph Millett was a **poor pioneer farmer** who lived in **the late 1800s**. One day, another man, who was struggling to feed his family, came to Joseph’s home and asked for help. Though Joseph himself had very little, he felt inspired to **give the man some flour from his own supply**.

That evening, Joseph recorded in his journal:

> *“Another poor man came for flour today, and I **gave him some of the last I had.** I don’t know when we’ll get more. But I **could not let him go hungry.**”*

He then added:

> *“And just as I was wondering what we would do, the Lord sent someone to pay me a debt, **which gave us enough to buy more flour.**”*

Joseph Millett considered it an honor to have God trust his faith.

The faith to give to his neighbor, what he lacked, knowing that God provides.

By the lesson's end, I resolved to extend the short term expressions of gratitude, suspending of man-made classifications and categories.

The teachings of religion as part of me, as a start.

But extend it to include, that who I am and the religion become as one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The level of teaching and edification is continually improving and expanding.

I think,

> it cannot get better than this

But it does.

The church and its people are growing.

And in some small way, perhaps my appreciation and spirituality has grown as well.
