Sometimes one understand and can predict the outcome.

At times, one has little what is going on.

Looking back, worked on some amazing projects.

Though at times, may be most of the time, I was lost, I kept at it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At times we apply for a role and get the job with virtually no training and certification.

It is totally an on-the-job training.

You are given a partner, for life and beyond, for this effort.i

If difficulties of the role was known beforehand and widely shared, there would be far less applicants.

Let us likewise honor the special place of the family. As James Q. Wilson wrote:

> “We learn to cope with the people of this world because we learn to cope with the members of our family. Those who flee the family flee the world; bereft of the \[family’s\] affection, tutelage, and challenges, they are unprepared for the \[world’s\] tests, judgments, and demands” (*The Moral Sense* \[1993\], 163).

How ironical that some go “into a far country” ([Luke 15:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)), leaving the nourishing family garden—in which there may be some weeds—and go into a desert with its tumbling sagebrush.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like serving a mission, in my family no one talked about it to me, I certainly wasn't pressured.

Having an idyllic time at a large university, where it was talked about but never forced.

Though when I turned 25, people in passing used the `menace`, as in

`> A menace to a society`

Bit strong, a person or thing that is likely to cause harm; a threat or danger.

*---*

Grateful for professors and students at BYU for teaching me how to conduct myself.

How free society functions, no compulsion, right principles.

Those members in the BYU 1st Stake that taught me how to live a life in the gospel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My training consisted of my family.

Watching other families in the church.

Teaching people of LA in their homes and getting a glimpse of a married life.

Spent a summer reading about the Eternal Marriage.

(found out later that Sister K read the same manual)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along with the conversion to the gospel.

Conversion to the marriage is an on-going effort.

No certificate is required, given at a time when two people of understanding years, make a commitment to be together and raise a family together.

Can't think of more wonderful show of faith.

Personal commitment, made in front of others.

Case of private commitment that is shared publicly
