Sometimes one understand and can predict the outcome.

At times, one has little what is going on.

Looking back, worked on some amazing projects.

Though at times, may be most of the time, I was lost, I kept at it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At times we apply for a role and get the job with virtually no training and certification.

It is totally an on-the-job training.

You are given a partner, for life and beyond, for this effort.i

If difficulties of the role was known beforehand and widely shared, there would be far less applicants.

Hiring manager that I work with commented.

> I just posted 2 open positions, I expected a barrage of AI-assisted applications

In addition, he expected to hear from those that are sure they meet all of the job requirements or exceed them.

Then, he would choose those that fit the company culture and would getting along with team members

With the knowledge and understanding that team or company specific knowledge and skills can be taught and learned

Once I interviewed for a position that was a stretch role.

Was surprised to receive a phone call from HR extending an offer.

Probably met some of the requirements, but it was in an industry that I haven't worked in for 15 years.

For the first several months, struggled to learn the role of Program Engineering Manager.

I wasn't enjoying the role.

With help from fellow PEMs and talking with other team members I learned the role.

My task is not to solve the issue but formulate the issue and bringin those with specific knowledge.

These were individuals that have devoted much of their career learning about a specific product.

In this case, FOG, Fiber Optic Gyroscope.

These were System Engineers and they were esteemed high by everyone.

We are selected for the role with little or no training.

We do not necessarily select those that have vaunted skills or manifest over confidence

Instead we select, as our partner, those that we can work together.

Because, we are trained, shaped and reshaped, first by our parents, then our companions, finally by our children and grandchildren.

Let us likewise honor the special place of the family. As James Q. Wilson wrote:

> “We learn to cope with the people of this world because we learn to cope with the members of our family. Those who flee the family flee the world; bereft of the \[family’s\] affection, tutelage, and challenges, they are unprepared for the \[world’s\] tests, judgments, and demands” (*The Moral Sense* \[1993\], 163).

How ironical that some go “into a far country” ([Luke 15:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)), leaving the nourishing family garden—in which there may be some weeds—and go into a desert with its tumbling sagebrush.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like serving a mission, in my family no one talked about it to me, I certainly wasn't pressured.

Having an idyllic time at a large university, where it was talked about but never forced.

Though when I turned 25, people in passing used the `menace`, as in

`> A menace to a society`

Bit strong, a person or thing that is likely to cause harm; a threat or danger.

*---*

Grateful for professors and students at BYU for teaching me how to conduct myself.

How free society functions, no compulsion, right principles.

Those members in the BYU 1st Stake that taught me how to live a life in the gospel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My training consisted of my family.

Watching other families in the church.

Teaching people of LA in their homes and getting a glimpse of a married life.

Spent a summer reading about the Eternal Marriage.

(found out later that Sister K read the same manual)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along with the conversion to the gospel.

Conversion to the marriage is an on-going effort.

No certificate is required, given at a time when two people of understanding years, make a commitment to be together and raise a family together.

Can't think of more wonderful show of faith.

Personal commitment, made in front of others.

Case of private commitment that is shared publicly

A **Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)** is a crucial component in missile navigation systems, providing highly accurate angular velocity measurements to ensure precise guidance and control. Here's how it works and why it's used:

### **How a FOG Works**

A Fiber Optic Gyroscope operates based on the **Sagnac Effect**, which is an optical phenomenon where light traveling in opposite directions through a coiled fiber experiences a phase shift when the system rotates. The key components include:

1.  

2.  **Coiled Optical Fiber** – Light is transmitted through several kilometers of fiber optic cable wound in a coil.

3.  

4.  **Laser Source** – A laser beam is split into two and sent in opposite directions through the fiber coil.

5.  

6.  **Interference Detection** – When the missile rotates, a phase shift occurs between the two light beams due to the Sagnac Effect, which is measured to determine angular velocity.

7.  

### **Why FOGs Are Used in Missile Navigation**

1.  

2.  **High Accuracy** – FOGs provide precise rotational data, crucial for guiding missiles toward their targets.

3.  

4.  **No Moving Parts** – Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, FOGs are solid-state, making them more reliable and durable.

5.  

6.  **Fast Response Time** – Optical signals are processed almost instantly, allowing real-time adjustments to missile trajectory.

7.  

8.  **Resistant to External Disturbances** – They are less affected by vibrations, accelerations, and electromagnetic interference, which are common in missile environments.

9.  

10. **Long Operational Life** – Due to their solid-state nature, they have a longer lifespan and lower maintenance requirements.

11. 

### **Application in Missile Systems**

FOGs are integrated into **Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)**, which track a missile’s position without relying on external signals like GPS. This makes them especially useful in:

-   **Ballistic Missiles** – Ensuring precise long-range targeting.

-   **Cruise Missiles** – Providing accurate navigation for terrain-following and target-seeking.

-   **Air-to-Air and Surface-to-Air Missiles** – Enhancing mid-course and terminal guidance.
