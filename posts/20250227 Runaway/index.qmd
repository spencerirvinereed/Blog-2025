Sister K and I use pass code once in a while.

Depending on her mood she responds with

-   No expression just a smile.
-   Go ahead, have fun and comeback soon
-   OK, let's go together. Where to?

It is a way for us to communicate how our day is going.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pass code is 도망가자

A literal translation is "Let's Runaway"

It could also mean, escape or hide, depending on its usage.

We must accept responsibility for a problem before we can solve it

M Scott Peck, Road Less Traveled, 1978

Finally made transition to face reality

Manager during expat years, his go to phrase was.

> Things aren't as bad as it seems nor is it as good as it seems.

Can we really outrun problems?

Are there problems we are destined (pre-ordained) to face - and overcome?
