> And the spirit and the body are the soul of man - Doctrine and Covenants 88:15

This is a theology of the faith I have chosen to live by.

A restaurant, like many public places, offers tangible items, music, food/beverages and the customer facing staff, seldom seen kitchen workers, a combinatin of colors and a choice of decor.

The aggregate result is an intangible feeling or vibe.

An advantage and thus the allure of restaurants is this,

On top of everything else it provides, it fulfills the core needs of humans.

Bonus if the environment or the vibe enhances the feeling of friendship that leads to a lasting union.

That feeling, when gazing across the table filled with food and drinks and see the person you have come to know and appreciate. Yet that person is seen differently

## Restaurant is a reflection or extension of owners

As owners, start with confidence that things will go as planned or better.

It is gratifying to see customers

## That restaurant in Southern France

Memorable visit after a tour of Rocamadour to Le Bourg. About a 10 mile trip

It was a Sunday supper, all of the seats were reserved and food was prepared accordingly My brother in law who served his mission in Italy talked to the owner/chef. We were famished.

He let us in. I believe others got less food as a result

Among the guests was this lady.

She was dining by herself.

Life well lived.
