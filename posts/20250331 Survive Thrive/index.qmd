Although my parents didn't give many direct lessons on life, I have learned aplenty.

If I had to summarize their life's teaching and motto in one word, it would be,

> Survive

They taught by living their life fully each day.

There are times when the life seems too complicated and full of worry.

Think through what they went through and didn't complaint

They didn't murmur

Growing up, hearing these stories were not impactful - immediately

However, I remembered the stories because they were given and received as teaching moments.

These recollections form the foundation of who they were and how I should emulate them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When my mother was 39 she studied and accepted a new religion.

She had been a Christian all her life.

She joined the church, then 말일성도 예수그리스도 교회.

Now 예수그리스도 후기성도 교회.

The acceptance of the Gospel and its abundant approach to life fit my parents' life.

Also the concept of temple worship and the eternal binding of family must have appealed to them.

They had both temporal foundation and eternal foundation.

When challenges came, they solved it based on their earthly experience and the heavenly perspective.

Thus when trials come these days, I do not think of escape as I once did.

I think of my parents, and wonder how they would have handled it.

The answer comes, quietly and reassuringly.

> Be still, and know that I am God
>
> Psalm 46:10

For I know the plan and the purpose of this life.

To walk the path that leads to eternal life.

The same path that my parents took, without murmuring.

The one they took on with a full faith and a measure of joy.

They struggled to survive, but thrived in their latter years.

Thank you Mom and Dad.
