Asked few questions to my 82 year old uncle in Korea.

The only surviving sibling and 13 years younger than my father.

Asked him when the family moved from 안변, North Korea to Seoul

He was born in the 12th month of 1943 according to the lunar calendar.

He was told, and recalls the family moved after he celebrated his 돌.

I was told, growing up, that my father worked for a furniture company ran by the Japanese company.

When Japan lost the WW2, all Japanese people returned home and left many things behind, includeing all real estate.

My father took over a house of a manager at an age of 15.5 years.

My uncle thought that it was more likely that his maternal uncle either owned the property or negotiated for that property to be transferred to my father.

Later on, his father would build a modern home on a government provided land.

My grandfather and dad's older brother were lost during the war.

Or they chose to side with the northern government.

My uncle tried to visit the site of that home and tried to reclaim it years later.

But he didn't want to go through the old memories.

My uncle mentioned my father belonged to a famous brigade.

백골(白骨) 부대^[<https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%A0%9C3%EB%B3%B4%EB%B3%91%EC%82%AC%EB%8B%A8>]

Whose motto was,

**죽어 백골이 되어서라도 조국을 수호하고 두고 온 [북녘 땅](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EB%B6%81%205%EB%8F%84 "이북 5도")을 자유의 품속으로 되찾고 말겠다**

Even if I die and become a skeleton, I will protect my country and bring back the North that I left behind into the arms of freedom.

Many of its initial members were from North Korea, who had witnessed atrocities (만행, 暴行) of communists.

Don't know for sure who had more accurate version of historical account.

I would believe the stories of my father over my uncle, since he lived it.

Was surprised that he didn't tell us he belonged to a well-known brigade that took part in many pivotal and fierce battles of the Korean War.

But that was like him and his generation.

They were fully involved in doing their duty and did everything to survive the war and during the ensuing rebuilding years

Then it is the next generation that needs to remember their experience.

Extract and keep the lessons and traditions.

As Abraham Lincoln said back in 10 November 1863 at Gettysburg Pennsylvania

> It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
>
> It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion —
>
> that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom

Thank you father, for your dedication and sacrifice in behalf the nation and for our family.
