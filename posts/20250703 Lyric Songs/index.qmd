Found a set of cassettes.

It was in a bottom drawer of set of 3 vertical drawers, of a stand that no longer graces the living room. It had been relegated to basement duties for a year and 7 years in storage before that.

It brought momentary delight as well as anticipation of listening to 5 hours of 韓国歌曲 Korean Folk Songs.

Even though most of these songs can be found on-line, it is nice to have one's own copy.

To digitize and to utilize the number of cassette decks made by artisans during the decades of 1980s and 1990s.

And to handle, feel and admire the workmanship and ingenuity that packs an hour of music into a 10.5 (L) x 7 (W) x 1.7 (H) mm bundle.

It has outer sleeve that has a 수채화 (水彩畫) or watercolor paiting on the front and the list of songs on the back, along with the composer of music, the author of lyrics, and the performer.

The cassette housing has an abbreviated song list, the manufacturer and the production date, 10 June 1985

There were 4 at the 답동지부, when our family was baptized.

Similar in age, within a grade or two in school, we all had 2 to 3 siblings.

Our families formed the core of the Branch.

Then 3 years later, our family moved to eastern US.

Shortly thereafter, J family moved to Seattle Area.

Both of us served missions stateside. Elder J in Chicago and I served in CLAM.

Lost contact with the 2 Lees that stayed in Korea.

Then, one of the Lees came for his MBA at BYU.

Once he returned to Korea, we seldom spoke.

The other Lee came to the local Korean congregation that meets in Orem.

We met for a lunch.

He filled me in on those pioneering families of the 인천 仁川 area.

He also recounted the struggles and challenges of being a member in Korea. Along with businesses that failed.

Eventually he chose to migrate to US and settle in Richmond, VA.

Reached out to my friend J in Seattle, the one that is up-to-date on status of the 4 members from Incheon. He asked the MBA Lee if he can meet when we visit Korea.

The came back quickly and emphatically, YES!

It was delightful to hear his voice and plan our visit back that home of our youth/childhood. An anticipation of seeing old places of memories and hopes of meeting childhood friends and acquaintances.

Perhaps, some of the themes in the Korean Lyrics/Folk Songs will be realized on this trip.

> Korean **folk** and **lyric songs** (민요 *minyo* and 가곡 *gagok*) often explore deeply emotional, cultural, and nature-connected themes. These songs reflect Korea’s agrarian past, Confucian values, hardships, and a lyrical appreciation of beauty.

Likewise I hope that the ways will be provided that will link and reunite families that were originally from North Korea.

I hope to contact my extended families and we will mend our differences and create new memories

By talking of Christ and His Gospel and talk of families members that are no longer here.

Partially fulfilling this verse in Revelation, Chapter 24.

> 4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.

A **cassette tape** is made of several materials, combining **plastic**, **magnetic coatings**, and **metal parts** to store and play analog audio. Here's a breakdown of its components:
---

## 🎞️ Tape Itself (Inside the Cassette)

### 📌 1. **Base Film (Plastic)**

-   Usually made of **polyester (PET)** or **polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)**

-   Acts as the flexible, durable backbone of the tape

### 📌 2. **Magnetic Coating**

-   Coated on one side of the plastic film

-   Contains **magnetic particles** that record audio signals

Common magnetic materials:

| Material                        | Used in...            |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Ferric oxide (Fe₂O₃)**        | Most standard tapes   |
| **Chromium dioxide (CrO₂)**     | Higher fidelity tapes |
| **Cobalt-modified iron oxide**  | High-output tapes     |
| **Metal particle (pure metal)** | Premium Type IV tapes |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💾 Cassette Housing (Shell)

Made of **rigid plastic**, often:

-   **Polystyrene** or **polycarbonate**

-   Transparent or opaque

-   Houses and protects the reels and tape

Contains:

-   Two **mini spools** to wind the tape

-   **Rollers**, **pads**, and **guide pins** to keep the tape aligned

-   **Screws** or welded plastic to seal it shut

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Other Internal Parts

| Part                  | Material             | Function                            |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pressure pad          | Felt on metal spring | Keeps tape pressed to playback head |
| Guide rollers         | Plastic or metal     | Smooth tape movement                |
| Anti-friction coating | Graphite backing     | Reduces wear and static             |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📏 Types of Tapes (Based on Magnetic Coating)

| Type | Coating Material       | Quality          |
|------|------------------------|------------------|
| I    | Ferric oxide           | Standard         |
| II   | Chrome or cobalt-doped | High bias        |
| III  | Ferri-chrome (rare)    | Experimental     |
| IV   | Metal particle         | Highest fidelity |
